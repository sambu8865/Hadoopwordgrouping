bizarre outside conventions humdrum
routine everyday life shown relish enthusiasm which prompted chronicle will excuse saying somewhat embellish many own
little adventures

sutherland strange effects extraordinary

upon morning begin narrative which promises one most singular which listened some
time heard remark strangest most unique
things very often connected larger smaller crimes occasionally indeed where there room doubt whether any positive crime been committed far heard impossible say whether present
case instance crime course events certainly among most singular ever listened perhaps wilson would great kindness recommence narrative ask merely because friend
watson heard opening part also because peculiar nature story makes anxious every
possible detail lips rule when heard some
slight indication course events able guide
myself thousands other similar cases which occur memory present instance forced admit facts best belief unique
portly client puffed out chest appearance some

said when wrote them they seemed come
when they typewritten always felt machine had come between will just show fond holmes little things would think
most suggestive said holmes long been axiom
mine little things infinitely most important
can remember any other little things about hosmer angel
very shy man holmes would rather walk evening than daylight said hated conspicuous very retiring gentlemanly even voice gentle hed had quinsy swollen glands when young told had left him weak throat
hesitating whispering fashion speech always
well dressed very neat plain eyes weak just
mine wore tinted glasses against glare
well what happened when windibank stepfather
returned france
hosmer angel came house again proposed should marry before father came back dreadful earnest
made swear hands testament whatever
happened would always true him mother said quite
right make swear sign passion
mother favour first even fonder
him than then when they talked marrying within week began ask about father they both said never mind about father just tell him afterwards mother
said would make right him didnt quite like
holmes seemed funny should ask leave only few years older than didnt want anything sly wrote father bordeaux where company its french offices letter came back very morning wedding

yes sir had started england just before arrived
unfortunate wedding arranged then friday church
yes sir very quietly saviours near
kings cross breakfast afterwards pancras hotel hosmer came hansom there two put both into stepped himself into fourwheeler which happened only other cab street got church first when fourwheeler
drove waited him step out never did when cabman got down box looked there one
there cabman said could imagine what had become
him had seen him get own eyes last friday holmes never seen heard anything
since then throw any light upon what became him
seems been very shamefully treated said
holmes
sir too good kind leave why morning saying whatever happened true even something quite unforeseen occurred separate always remember pledged him
would claim pledge sooner later seemed
strange talk weddingmorning what happened since
gives meaning most certainly does own opinion then some
unforeseen catastrophe occurred him
yes sir believe foresaw some danger else would talked then think what foresaw
happened
notion what could been
none
one more question did mother take matter
angry said never speak matter
again
father did tell him
yes seemed think something had
happened should hear hosmer again said
what interest could anyone bringing doors church then leaving now had borrowed money had married got money settled him
there might some reason hosmer very independent about
money never would look shilling mine yet what
could happened why could write drives halfmad think cant sleep wink night pulled little handkerchief out muff began sob
heavily into shall glance into case said holmes rising doubt shall reach some definite result let weight matter rest upon now let mind
dwell upon further above try let hosmer angel
vanish memory done life
then dont think ill see him again
fear then what happened him
will leave question hands should like accurate description him any letters which can
spare
advertised him last saturdays chronicle said here slip here four letters him

leave papers here remember advice which given
let whole incident sealed book allow affect life
very kind holmes cannot shall true hosmer shall find ready when comes back
preposterous hat vacuous face there something noble simple faith visitor which
compelled respect laid little bundle papers upon
table went way promise come again whenever
might summoned
sherlock holmes sat silent few minutes fingertips
still pressed together legs stretched out front him
gaze directed upward ceiling then took down
rack old oily clay pipe which him counsellor having lit leaned back chair thick blue cloudwreaths spinning him look infinite languor face
quite interesting study maiden observed found
more interesting than little problem which way
rather trite one will find parallel cases consult index andover there something sort hague last year old idea however
there one two details which new maiden herself most instructive
appeared read good deal upon which quite
invisible remarked
invisible unnoticed watson did know where look missed important can never bring

one remarkable point however which will doubt strike
they typewritten remarked
only signature typewritten look neat little hosmer angel bottom there date see superscription except leadenhall street which rather vague point about signature very suggestive
fact may call conclusive

who then what object deserting miss
sutherland
question hardly out mouth holmes had yet
opened lips reply when heard heavy footfall passage tap door
girls stepfather james windibank said
holmes written say would here six come man who entered sturdy middlesized fellow some
thirty years age cleanshaven sallowskinned bland insinuating manner pair wonderfully sharp penetrating grey eyes shot questioning glance each placed shiny tophat upon sideboard slight bow sidled down into nearest chair
goodevening james windibank said holmes think typewritten letter which made appointment six oclock
yes sir afraid little late quite own master know sorry miss sutherland
troubled about little matter think far
better wash linen sort public quite
against wishes came very excitable
impulsive girl may noticed easily
controlled when made mind point course did mind much connected official police pleasant family
misfortune like noised abroad besides useless
expense could possibly find hosmer angel
contrary said holmes quietly every reason believe will succeed discovering hosmer angel
windibank gave violent start dropped gloves delighted hear said
curious thing remarked holmes typewriter really quite much individuality mans handwriting unless
they quite new two them write exactly alike some
letters get more worn than others some wear only one
side now remark note yours windibank every case there some little slurring over slight defect tail there fourteen other
characteristics those more obvious
correspondence machine office
doubt little worn visitor answered glancing
keenly holmes bright little eyes
now will show what really very interesting study
windibank holmes continued think writing another
little monograph some these days typewriter its
relation crime subject which devoted some
little attention here four letters which purport come
missing man they typewritten each case only slurred tailless will
observe care use magnifying lens fourteen
other characteristics which alluded there well
windibank sprang out chair picked hat cannot waste time over sort fantastic talk holmes
said can catch man catch him let know
when done certainly said holmes stepping over turning key door let know then caught him
what where shouted windibank turning white lips
glancing about him like rat trap
wont doreally wont said holmes suavely there
possible getting out windibank quite too
transparent very bad compliment when said impossible solve simple question thats
right sit down let talk over
visitor collapsed into chair ghastly face glitter moisture brow itits actionable stammered
very much afraid between ourselves
windibank cruel selfish heartless trick petty way ever came before now let just run over course events will contradict wrong
man sat huddled chair head sunk upon breast like one who utterly crushed holmes stuck feet corner mantelpiece leaning back hands
pockets began talking rather himself seemed
than man married woman very much older than himself money said enjoyed use money daughter long lived them considerable
sum people their position loss would made serious difference worth effort preserve daughter good amiable disposition affectionate
warmhearted ways evident fair personal advantages little income would
allowed remain single long now marriage would
mean course loss hundred year what does stepfather prevent takes obvious course keeping home forbidding seek company people own age soon found would answer forever became restive insisted upon rights finally announced positive intention going certain
ball what does clever stepfather then conceives idea more creditable head than heart connivance assistance wife disguised himself
covered those keen eyes tinted glasses masked face moustache pair bushy whiskers sunk clear voice
into insinuating whisper doubly secure account girls short sight appears hosmer angel keeps off
other lovers making love himself
only joke first groaned visitor never
thought would been carried away
very likely however may young lady very
decidedly carried away having quite made mind stepfather france suspicion treachery never
instant entered mind flattered gentlemans attentions effect increased loudly expressed admiration mother then angel began
call obvious matter should pushed far would real effect produced there
meetings engagement which would finally secure girls affections turning towards anyone else deception could kept forever these pretended journeys
france rather cumbrous thing clearly bring business end such dramatic manner would leave permanent impression upon young ladys mind prevent looking upon any other suitor some time come hence those vows fidelity exacted upon testament hence also allusions possibility something happening
very morning wedding james windibank wished miss
sutherland bound hosmer angel uncertain fate ten years come any rate would listen another man far church door brought then could farther conveniently vanished
away old trick stepping one door fourwheeler out other think chain events windibank
visitor had recovered something assurance while holmes
had been talking rose chair now cold
sneer upon pale face
may may holmes said very sharp ought sharp enough know who breaking law now done nothing
actionable first long keep door
locked lay yourself open action assault illegal
constraint
law cannot say touch said holmes unlocking
throwing open door yet there never man who
deserved punishment more young lady brother friend ought lay whip across shoulders jove
continued flushing sight bitter sneer upon
mans face part duties client heres hunting crop handy think shall just treat
myself took two swift steps whip before could grasp there wild clatter steps upon stairs
heavy hall door banged window could see james windibank running top speed down road
theres coldblooded scoundrel said holmes laughing threw himself down into chair once more fellow will
rise crime crime until does something very bad ends gallows case some respects been entirely devoid interest
cannot now entirely see steps reasoning remarked
well course obvious first hosmer angel must some strong object curious
conduct equally clear only man who really
profited incident far could see stepfather then fact two men never together
one always appeared when other away suggestive tinted spectacles curious voice
which both hinted disguise did bushy whiskers suspicions confirmed peculiar action typewriting signature which course inferred handwriting familiar would recognise even
smallest sample see these isolated facts
together many minor ones pointed same

had carriage ourselves save immense litter papers which holmes had brought him among these rummaged
read intervals notetaking meditation until
past reading then suddenly rolled them into gigantic ball tossed them onto rack
heard anything case asked
word seen paper some days
london press had very full accounts just
been looking through recent papers order master particulars seems what gather one those
simple cases which extremely difficult
sounds little paradoxical
profoundly true singularity almost invariably clue more featureless commonplace crime more
difficult bring home case however they
established very serious case against son murdered man
murder then
well conjectured shall take nothing granted until opportunity looking personally into
will explain state things far been able understand very few words
boscombe valley country district very far ross herefordshire largest landed proprietor part john turner who made money australia returned
some years ago old country one farms which held hatherley let charles mccarthy who also exaustralian men had known each other colonies unnatural when they came settle down they should near each other possible
turner apparently richer man mccarthy became tenant still remained seems upon terms perfect
equality they frequently together mccarthy had one son
lad eighteen turner had only daughter same
age neither them had wives living they appear avoided society neighbouring english families led retired lives though both mccarthys fond sport frequently seen racemeetings neighbourhood mccarthy kept two servantsa man girl
turner had considerable household some halfdozen least much been able gather about families now facts
june monday last mccarthy left house hatherley about three afternoon walked down boscombe pool which small lake formed spreading out
stream which runs down boscombe valley had been
out servingman morning ross had told
man must hurry had appointment importance keep three appointment never came
back alive
hatherley farmhouse boscombe pool quarter mile two people saw him passed over ground one
old woman whose name mentioned other william crowder gamekeeper employ turner both
these witnesses depose mccarthy walking alone gamekeeper adds within few minutes seeing mccarthy pass had seen son james mccarthy going same way gun under arm best belief father actually sight time son following him thought more matter until heard evening tragedy had occurred
two mccarthys seen after time when william crowder
gamekeeper lost sight them boscombe pool thickly
wooded round just fringe grass reeds round edge girl fourteen patience moran who daughter lodgekeeper boscombe valley estate one woods picking flowers states while there saw border wood close lake mccarthy son they appeared having violent quarrel heard mccarthy elder using very
strong language son saw latter raise hand strike father frightened their
violence ran away told mother when reached
home had left two mccarthys quarrelling near
boscombe pool afraid they going fight had hardly said words when young mccarthy came
running lodge say had found father dead
wood ask help lodgekeeper much excited without either gun hat right
hand sleeve observed stained fresh blood following him they found dead body stretched out upon grass beside pool head had been beaten repeated
blows some heavy blunt weapon injuries such might very well been inflicted buttend sons
gun which found lying grass within few paces body under these circumstances young man instantly
arrested verdict wilful murder having been returned
inquest tuesday wednesday brought before magistrates ross who referred case next
assizes those main facts case they came out
before coroner policecourt
could hardly imagine more damning case remarked ever circumstantial evidence pointed criminal does here
circumstantial evidence very tricky thing answered holmes
thoughtfully may seem point very straight one thing
shift own point view little may find pointing equally uncompromising manner something
entirely different must confessed however case
looks exceedingly grave against young man very
possible indeed culprit there several people
neighbourhood however among them miss turner daughter neighbouring landowner who believe innocence who retained lestrade whom may recollect
connection study scarlet work out case interest lestrade being rather puzzled referred case hence two middleaged gentlemen flying westward fifty miles hour instead quietly
digesting their breakfasts home
afraid said facts obvious will find little credit gained out case
there nothing more deceptive than obvious fact answered laughing besides may chance hit upon some
other obvious facts which may been means obvious lestrade know too well think boasting
when say shall either confirm destroy theory means which quite incapable employing even understanding take first example hand very clearly
perceive bedroom window upon righthand
side yet question whether lestrade would noted
even selfevident thing earth
dear fellow know well know military neatness
which characterises shave every morning season shave sunlight since shaving less
less complete get farther back left side until
becomes positively slovenly get round angle jaw surely very clear side less illuminated
than other could imagine man habits looking
himself equal light being satisfied such result only quote trivial example observation inference therein lies mtier just possible may some service investigation which lies before
there one two minor points which brought out inquest which worth considering
what they
appears arrest did take place once after
return hatherley farm inspector constabulary
informing him prisoner remarked surprised hear more than deserts
observation had natural effect removing any
traces doubt which might remained minds coroners jury
confession ejaculated
followed protestation innocence
coming top such damning series events least most suspicious remark
contrary said holmes brightest rift which can present see clouds however innocent might could such absolute imbecile see circumstances very black against him had appeared
surprised own arrest feigned indignation should looked upon highly suspicious because such
surprise anger would natural under circumstances
yet might appear best policy scheming man frank acceptance situation marks him either innocent
man else man considerable selfrestraint firmness remark about deserts also unnatural consider stood beside dead body father there doubt had very day
far forgotten filial duty bandy words him even according little girl whose evidence important raise hand strike him selfreproach contrition which displayed remark
appear signs healthy mind rather than guilty one
shook head many men been hanged far slighter
evidence remarked
they many men been wrongfully hanged
what young mans own account matter
afraid very encouraging supporters
though there one two points which suggestive
will find here may read yourself
picked out bundle copy local herefordshire
paper having turned down sheet pointed out paragraph which unfortunate young man had given own
statement what had occurred settled myself down corner carriage read very carefully ran way
james mccarthy only son deceased then called
gave evidence follows had been away home three days bristol had only just returned upon morning last monday father absent home time arrival informed maid had driven over ross john cobb groom shortly after
return heard wheels trap yard looking out window saw him get out walk rapidly out
yard though aware which direction going then took gun strolled out direction boscombe pool intention visiting rabbit
warren which upon other side way saw william
crowder gamekeeper had stated evidence mistaken thinking following father had
idea front when about hundred yards
pool heard cry cooee which usual signal
between father myself then hurried forward found
him standing pool appeared much surprised seeing asked rather roughly what doing there conversation ensued which led high words almost blows
father man very violent temper seeing passion becoming ungovernable left him returned
towards hatherley farm had gone more than yards
however when heard hideous outcry behind which caused run back again found father expiring upon ground
head terribly injured dropped gun held him arms almost instantly expired knelt beside him some minutes then made way turners lodgekeeper
house being nearest ask assistance saw one
near father when returned idea came injuries popular man being somewhat cold forbidding manners had far know active enemies know nothing further matter
coroner did father make any statement before
died
witness mumbled few words could only catch some
allusion rat
coroner what did understand witness conveyed meaning thought delirious
coroner what point upon which father
had final quarrel
witness should prefer answer
coroner afraid must press witness really impossible tell can
assure nothing sad tragedy which
followed
coroner court decide need point
out refusal answer will prejudice case
considerably any future proceedings which may arise
witness must still refuse
coroner understand cry cooee common
signal between father
witness coroner then uttered before saw
before even knew had returned bristol
witness considerable confusion know
juryman did see nothing which aroused suspicions
when returned hearing cry found father
fatally injured
witness nothing definite
coroner what mean
witness disturbed excited rushed out into
open could think nothing except father yet
vague impression ran forward something lay
upon ground left seemed something grey colour coat some sort plaid perhaps
when rose father looked round gone
mean disappeared before went help
yes gone
cannot say what had feeling something there
far body
dozen yards far edge wood
about same
then removed while within dozen
yards yes back towards concluded examination witness
see said glanced down column coroner
concluding remarks rather severe upon young mccarthy
calls attention reason discrepancy about father having signalled him before seeing him also refusal give details conversation father singular account fathers dying words they remarks very much against son
holmes laughed softly himself stretched himself out upon
cushioned seat both coroner been some
pains said single out very strongest points young mans favour dont see alternately give him
credit having too much imagination too little too
little could invent cause quarrel which would
give him sympathy jury too much evolved own inner consciousness anything outr dying
reference rat incident vanishing cloth sir shall approach case point view what
young man says true shall see whither hypothesis will lead now here pocket petrarch another word shall say case until scene action lunch swindon see shall there twenty minutes
nearly four oclock when last after passing through
beautiful stroud valley over broad gleaming severn
found ourselves pretty little countrytown ross lean ferretlike man furtive slylooking waiting upon platform spite light brown dustcoat leatherleggings which wore deference rustic
surroundings had difficulty recognising lestrade scotland yard him drove hereford arms where room had already been engaged ordered carriage said lestrade sat over cup
tea knew energetic nature would happy until had been scene crime
very nice complimentary holmes answered entirely question barometric pressure
lestrade looked startled quite follow said
glass twentynine see wind cloud
sky caseful cigarettes here which need
smoking sofa very much superior usual country
hotel abomination think probable shall use carriage tonight
lestrade laughed indulgently doubt already formed
conclusions newspapers said case plain pikestaff more one goes into plainer
becomes still course one cant refuse lady such very positive one too heard would opinion though repeatedly told there nothing
which could which had already done why bless soul here carriage door
had hardly spoken before there rushed into room one most lovely young women ever seen life violet eyes shining lips parted pink flush upon cheeks thought natural reserve lost overpowering excitement concern
sherlock holmes cried glancing one other finally womans quick intuition
fastening upon companion glad come driven down tell know james didnt know want start upon work knowing too never let yourself doubt upon point known each
other since little children know faults one else does too tenderhearted hurt fly such charge absurd anyone who really knows him
hope may clear him miss turner said sherlock holmes
may rely upon doing can
read evidence formed some conclusion
see some loophole some flaw yourself
think innocent
think very probable
there now cried throwing back head looking
defiantly lestrade hear gives hopes
lestrade shrugged shoulders afraid colleague
been little quick forming conclusions said
right know right james never did
about quarrel father sure reason why would speak about coroner because
concerned what way asked holmes
time hide anything james father had
many disagreements about mccarthy very anxious there should marriage between james always
loved each other brother sister course young
seen very little life yet andandwell naturally did wish anything like yet there
quarrels sure one them
father asked holmes favour such union
averse also one mccarthy favour quick blush passed over fresh young face holmes shot one keen questioning glances thank information said may see father
call tomorrow
afraid doctor wont allow doctor
yes heard poor father never been strong years back broken him down completely taken
bed willows says wreck nervous system shattered mccarthy only man alive
who had known dad old days victoria
victoria important
yes mines
quite goldmines where understand turner
made money
yes certainly
thank miss turner been material assistance will tell any news tomorrow doubt will prison see james holmes tell him know him innocent
will miss turner
must home now dad very ill misses leave him goodbye god help undertaking hurried room impulsively had entered heard wheels carriage rattle off down street
ashamed holmes said lestrade dignity after few minutes silence why should raise hopes which bound disappoint overtender heart call cruel
think see way clearing james mccarthy said
holmes order see him prison
yes only then shall reconsider resolution about going out still time take train hereford see him tonight
ample
then let watson fear will find very
slow shall only away couple hours
walked down station them then wandered through
streets little town finally returning hotel
where lay upon sofa tried interest myself yellowbacked novel puny plot story thin
however when compared deep mystery through which groping found attention wander continually action fact last flung across room gave myself entirely consideration events day supposing unhappy young mans story absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely
unforeseen extraordinary calamity could occurred between
time when parted father moment when
drawn back screams rushed into glade something terrible deadly what could might nature injuries reveal something medical instincts
rang bell called weekly county paper which
contained verbatim account inquest surgeons
deposition stated posterior third left
parietal bone left half occipital bone had been
shattered heavy blow blunt weapon marked spot
upon own head clearly such blow must been struck behind some extent favour accused when
seen quarrelling face face father still did very much older man might turned back before blow fell still might worth while call
holmes attention then there peculiar dying
reference rat what could mean could delirium man dying sudden blow does commonly become
delirious more likely attempt explain met fate what could indicate cudgelled brains find some possible explanation then incident
grey cloth seen young mccarthy true murderer must dropped some part dress presumably overcoat flight must had hardihood return carry away instant when son kneeling back turned dozen paces off what tissue mysteries improbabilities whole thing did wonder lestrades opinion yet had much faith
sherlock holmes insight could lose hope long
every fresh fact seemed strengthen conviction young
mccarthys innocence
late before sherlock holmes returned came back alone
lestrade staying lodgings town
glass still keeps very high remarked sat down
importance should rain before able
over ground other hand man should very best keenest such nice work did wish when fagged long journey seen young
mccarthy
what did learn him
nothing
could throw light
none inclined think one time knew
who had done screening him convinced
now puzzled everyone else very
quickwitted youth though comely look should think
sound heart
cannot admire taste remarked indeed fact
averse marriage charming young lady miss turner
thereby hangs rather painful tale fellow madly
insanely love some two years ago when only lad before really knew had been away
five years boardingschool what does idiot get
into clutches barmaid bristol marry registry office one knows word matter can
imagine maddening must him upbraided doing what would give very eyes what knows
absolutely impossible sheer frenzy sort
which made him throw hands into air when father
their last interview goading him propose miss
turner other hand had means supporting himself
father who accounts very hard man would
thrown him over utterly had known truth barmaid wife had spent last three days bristol father did know where mark point importance good come out evil however
barmaid finding papers serious
trouble likely hanged thrown him over utterly written him say husband already bermuda dockyard there really tie between them think bit news consoled young mccarthy suffered
innocent who done who would call attention very particularly two
points one murdered man had appointment someone pool someone could been son son away did know when would
return second murdered man heard cry
cooee before knew son had returned those crucial points upon which case depends now let talk
about george meredith please shall leave minor matters until tomorrow
there rain holmes had foretold morning broke
bright cloudless nine oclock lestrade called carriage set off hatherley farm boscombe
pool
there serious news morning lestrade observed said turner hall ill life despaired elderly man presume said holmes
about sixty constitution been shattered life
abroad been failing health some time business had very bad effect upon him old friend
mccarthys may add great benefactor him learned gave him hatherley farm rent free
indeed interesting said holmes
yes hundred other ways helped him everybody
about here speaks kindness him
really does strike little singular mccarthy who appears had little own been under such obligations turner should still talk marrying son turners daughter who presumably
heiress estate such very cocksure manner
merely case proposal else would
follow more strange since know turner himself
averse idea daughter told much deduce something got deductions inferences said
lestrade winking find hard enough tackle facts
holmes without flying away after theories fancies
right said holmes demurely find very hard
tackle facts
anyhow grasped one fact which seem find difficult get hold replied lestrade some warmth
mccarthy senior met death mccarthy junior theories contrary merest moonshine
well moonshine brighter thing than fog said holmes
laughing very much mistaken hatherley
farm upon left
yes widespread comfortablelooking
building twostoried slateroofed great yellow blotches
lichen upon grey walls drawn blinds smokeless
chimneys however gave stricken look though weight
horror still lay heavy upon called door
when maid holmes request showed boots which master wore time death also pair sons though pair which had then had having measured
these very carefully seven eight different points holmes
desired led courtyard which followed
winding track which led boscombe pool
sherlock holmes transformed when hot upon such scent
men who had only known quiet thinker logician baker street would failed recognise him face flushed
darkened brows drawn into two hard black lines
while eyes shone out beneath them steely glitter
face bent downward shoulders bowed lips
compressed veins stood out like whipcord long
sinewy neck nostrils seemed dilate purely animal
lust chase mind absolutely concentrated
upon matter before him question remark fell
unheeded upon ears most only provoked quick
impatient snarl reply swiftly silently made way
along track which ran through meadows way woods boscombe pool damp marshy ground district there marks many feet both upon
path amid short grass which bounded either
side sometimes holmes would hurry sometimes stop dead once made quite little detour into meadow lestrade walked behind him detective indifferent contemptuous
while watched friend interest which sprang conviction every one actions directed towards definite end
boscombe pool which little reedgirt sheet water
some fifty yards across situated boundary between hatherley farm private park wealthy turner
above woods which lined upon farther side could see
red jutting pinnacles which marked site rich
landowners dwelling hatherley side pool woods
grew very thick there narrow belt sodden grass
twenty paces across between edge trees reeds
which lined lake lestrade showed exact spot which
body had been found indeed moist ground
could plainly see traces which had been left fall stricken man holmes could see eager
face peering eyes very many other things read
upon trampled grass ran round like dog who picking
scent then turned upon companion
what did into pool asked
fished about rake thought there might some weapon
other trace earth
tut tut time left foot yours its
inward twist over place mole could trace there vanishes among reeds simple would been had been here before they came like herd buffalo
wallowed over here where party lodgekeeper came they covered tracks six eight feet round body here three separate tracks same feet drew out lens lay down upon waterproof better view talking time rather himself than these young mccarthys feet twice walking once ran swiftly soles deeply marked heels hardly visible bears out story ran when saw father ground then here fathers feet paced down what then buttend gun son stood listening what here tiptoes tiptoes square too quite
unusual boots they come they they come againof course
cloak now where did they come ran down sometimes losing sometimes finding track until well within edge wood under shadow great beech largest tree neighbourhood holmes traced
way farther side lay down once more upon
face little cry satisfaction long time remained there turning over leaves dried sticks
gathering what seemed dust into envelope examining lens only ground even bark tree far could reach jagged stone lying among
moss also carefully examined retained then
followed pathway through wood until came highroad where traces lost
been case considerable interest remarked
returning natural manner fancy grey house right must lodge think will word moran perhaps write little note having done
may drive back luncheon may walk cab
shall presently
about ten minutes before regained cab drove
back into ross holmes still carrying him stone which had picked wood
may interest lestrade remarked holding out
murder done see marks
there none
know then
grass growing under had only lain there few
days there sign place whence had been taken corresponds injuries there sign any other
weapon
murderer
tall man lefthanded limps right leg wears
thicksoled shootingboots grey cloak smokes indian
cigars uses cigarholder carries blunt penknife pocket there several other indications these may enough aid search
lestrade laughed afraid still sceptic said theories very well deal hardheaded british jury
nous verrons answered holmes calmly work own
method shall work mine shall busy afternoon
shall probably return london evening train
leave case unfinished
finished
mystery
solved
who criminal then
gentleman describe
who surely would difficult find out such populous neighbourhood
lestrade shrugged shoulders practical man said
really cannot undertake about country looking
lefthanded gentleman game leg should become laughingstock scotland yard
right said holmes quietly given chance
here lodgings goodbye shall drop line before
leave
having left lestrade rooms drove hotel where
found lunch upon table holmes silent buried thought pained expression upon face one who finds
himself perplexing position
look here watson said when cloth cleared just sit
down chair let preach little dont
know quite what should value advice light cigar let expound
pray well now considering case there two points about
young mccarthys narrative which struck both instantly
although they impressed favour against him one
fact father should according account
cry cooee before seeing him other singular dying
reference rat mumbled several words understand caught sons ear now double
point research must commence will begin presuming what lad says absolutely true
what cooee then
well obviously could been meant son son far knew bristol mere chance within earshot cooee meant attract attention whoever had appointment cooee distinctly australian cry one which used
between australians there strong presumption person whom mccarthy expected meet him boscombe pool someone who had been australia
what rat then
sherlock holmes took folded paper pocket flattened
out table map colony victoria
said wired bristol last night put hand
over part map what read
arat read
now raised hand
ballarat
quite word man uttered which son only caught last two syllables trying utter
name murderer ballarat
wonderful exclaimed
obvious now see had narrowed field down
considerably possession grey garment third point
which granting sons statement correct certainty come now out mere vagueness definite
conception australian ballarat grey cloak
certainly
one who home district pool can only
approached farm estate where strangers could
hardly wander
quite then comes expedition today examination ground gained trifling details which gave imbecile lestrade personality criminal
did gain them
know method founded upon observation trifles
height know might roughly judge length
stride boots too might told their traces
yes they peculiar boots
lameness
impression right foot always less distinct than
left put less weight upon why because limpedhe
lame
lefthandedness

unless lefthanded man had stood behind
tree during interview between father son had
even smoked there found ash cigar which special

cigar know devoted some attention written little monograph ashes different
varieties pipe cigar cigarette tobacco having found ash then looked round discovered stump among moss
where had tossed indian cigar variety

holmes said drawn net round man which
cannot escape saved innocent human life truly had cut cord which hanging him see direction which points culprit john turner cried hotel waiter opening door sittingroom ushering visitor
man who entered strange impressive figure slow limping step bowed shoulders gave appearance decrepitude yet hard deeplined craggy features enormous limbs showed possessed unusual
strength body character tangled beard grizzled
hair outstanding drooping eyebrows combined give air
dignity power appearance face ashen white while lips corners nostrils tinged shade blue clear glance grip some deadly chronic disease
pray sit down sofa said holmes gently had note
yes lodgekeeper brought said wished see here avoid scandal
thought people would talk went hall
why did wish see looked across companion despair weary eyes though question
already answered
yes said holmes answering look rather than words know about mccarthy
old man sank face hands god help cried
would let young man come harm give word would spoken out went against him assizes
glad hear say said holmes gravely
would spoken now had been dear girl would break heartit will break heart when hears
arrested

who required presence here acting interests
young mccarthy must got off however
dying man said old turner had diabetes years doctor says question whether shall live month yet would rather die under own roof than gaol
holmes rose sat down table pen hand
bundle paper before him just tell truth said shall jot down facts will sign watson
here can witness then could produce confession last extremity save young mccarthy promise shall
use unless absolutely needed
its well said old man its question whether shall live assizes matters little should wish spare alice shock now will make thing clear been long time acting will take long tell

talk over
when went down there found him talking son smoked cigar waited behind tree until should alone
listened talk black bitter seemed come uppermost urging son marry daughter little regard what might think slut off streets drove mad think held most dear should power such man could snap bond already dying desperate man though clear mind fairly strong limb
knew own fate sealed memory girl
both could saved could silence foul tongue did holmes would again deeply sinned
led life martyrdom atone girl

pray sir what intend view health nothing yourself aware will soon answer deed higher court than assizes will keep confession mccarthy condemned shall forced use shall never seen mortal eye secret whether alive dead shall safe farewell then said old man solemnly own deathbeds
when they come will easier thought peace

play such tricks poor helpless worms never hear such
case think baxters words say

impression upon pondered over turned every
way mind without being able make anything yet could shake off vague feeling dread which left
behind though sensation grew less keen weeks passed
nothing happened disturb usual routine lives could see change uncle however drank more than ever
less inclined any sort society most time would spend room door locked upon inside sometimes would emerge sort drunken frenzy

cooped like sheep pen man devil when these hot fits over however would
rush tumultuously door lock bar behind him
like man who can brazen out longer against terror
which lies roots soul such times seen

well come end matter holmes abuse patience there came night when made one those
drunken sallies which never came back found him when
went search him face downward little
greenscummed pool which lay foot garden there
sign any violence water two feet deep
jury having regard known eccentricity
brought verdict suicide who knew winced
very thought death had much ado persuade myself
had gone out way meet matter passed
however father entered into possession estate some pounds which lay credit bank
one moment holmes interposed statement foresee
one most remarkable which ever listened let date reception uncle letter date supposed suicide
letter arrived march death seven weeks
later upon night may thank pray proceed
when father took over horsham property request made careful examination attic which had been
always locked found brass box there although its
contents had been destroyed inside cover paper label initials repeated upon letters memoranda receipts register written beneath
these presume indicated nature papers which had
been destroyed colonel openshaw rest there nothing much importance attic save great many
scattered papers notebooks bearing upon uncles life america some them war time showed had
done duty well had borne repute brave soldier
others date during reconstruction southern
states mostly concerned politics had
evidently taken strong part opposing carpetbag
politicians who had been sent down north
well beginning when father came live horsham went well possible until january fourth day after new year heard father give sharp cry surprise sat together breakfasttable there sitting newly opened
envelope one hand five dried orange pips outstretched palm other one had always laughed what
called cockandbull story about colonel looked
very scared puzzled now same thing had come upon
himself
why what earth does mean john stammered
heart had turned lead said looked inside envelope cried here very letters what written above them
put papers sundial read peeping over shoulder
what papers what sundial asked
sundial garden there other said papers must those destroyed
pooh said gripping hard courage civilised land here cant tomfoolery kind
where does thing come dundee answered glancing postmark
some preposterous practical joke said what sundials papers shall take notice such
nonsense
should certainly speak police said
laughed pains nothing sort
then let forbid wont fuss made about such
nonsense
vain argue him very obstinate
man went about however heart which full forebodings
third day after coming letter father went
home visit old friend major freebody who command one forts upon portsdown hill glad
should seemed farther danger when away home however error upon second day absence received telegram
major imploring come once father had
fallen over one deep chalkpits which abound neighbourhood lying senseless shattered skull hurried him passed away without having ever recovered
consciousness had appears been returning fareham twilight country unknown him
chalkpit unfenced jury had hesitation bringing verdict death accidental causes
carefully examined every fact connected death unable find anything which could suggest idea murder there signs violence footmarks robbery record strangers having been seen upon roads
yet need tell mind far ease
wellnigh certain some foul plot had been
woven round him
sinister way came into inheritance will ask why did dispose answer because well
convinced troubles some way dependent upon incident uncles life danger would pressing one house another
january poor father met end two
years eight months elapsed since then during time
lived happily horsham had begun hope curse had passed away family had ended
last generation had begun take comfort too soon
however yesterday morning blow fell very shape which had come upon father
young man took waistcoat crumpled envelope turning table shook out upon five little dried
orange pips
envelope continued postmark londoneastern division within very words which upon fathers last message then put papers sundial
what done asked holmes
nothing
nothing
tell truthhe sank face into thin white
handsi felt helpless felt like one those poor
rabbits when snake writhing towards seem grasp some resistless inexorable evil which foresight
precautions can guard against
tut tut cried sherlock holmes must act man lost nothing energy can save time despair
seen police
they listened story smile convinced inspector formed opinion letters practical jokes deaths relations really
accidents jury stated connected warnings
holmes shook clenched hands air incredible
imbecility cried
they however allowed policeman who may remain house come tonight
orders stay house
again holmes raved air
why did come cried above why did come once
did know only today spoke major
prendergast about troubles advised him come really two days since had letter should acted before further evidence suppose than
which placed before usno suggestive detail which
might help there one thing said john openshaw rummaged coat
pocket drawing out piece discoloured bluetinted
paper laid out upon table some remembrance
said day when uncle burned papers observed small unburned margins which lay amid ashes particular colour found single sheet
upon floor room inclined think may one papers which perhaps fluttered out among others way escaped destruction beyond
mention pips see helps much think
myself page some private diary writing undoubtedly uncles
holmes moved lamp both bent over sheet paper
which showed its ragged edge had indeed been torn book headed march beneath following enigmatical notices
hudson came same old platform
set pips mccauley paramore john swain augustine
mccauley cleared
john swain cleared
visited paramore well
thank said holmes folding paper returning visitor now must account lose another
instant cannot spare time even discuss what told
must get home instantly act
what shall there one thing must done once must
put piece paper which shown into brass
box which described must also put note say
other papers burned uncle only one which remains must assert such
words will carry conviction them having done must once put box out upon sundial directed understand
entirely
think revenge anything sort present think may gain means law web weave while theirs already woven first
consideration remove pressing danger which threatens
second clear mystery punish guilty parties
thank said young man rising pulling overcoat given fresh life hope shall
certainly advise
lose instant above take care yourself meanwhile think there can doubt threatened very real imminent danger back
train waterloo
yet nine streets will crowded trust may safety yet cannot guard yourself too
closely
armed
well tomorrow shall set work upon case
shall see horsham then
secret lies london there shall seek
then shall call upon day two days news
box papers shall take advice every
particular shook hands took leave outside
wind still screamed rain splashed pattered
against windows strange wild story seemed come
amid mad elementsblown upon like sheet
seaweed galeand now been reabsorbed them
once more
sherlock holmes sat some time silence head sunk
forward eyes bent upon red glow fire then lit pipe leaning back chair watched blue
smokerings they chased each other ceiling
think watson remarked last cases had none more fantastic than save perhaps sign four
well yes save perhaps yet john openshaw seems
walking amid even greater perils than did sholtos
asked formed any definite conception what these perils there can question their nature answered
then what they who why does pursue
unhappy family
sherlock holmes closed eyes placed elbows upon arms chair fingertips together ideal
reasoner remarked would when had once been shown single fact its bearings deduce only chain events which led also results which
would follow cuvier could correctly describe whole
animal contemplation single bone observer who
thoroughly understood one link series incidents
should able accurately state other ones both
before after yet grasped results which reason alone can attain problems may solved study
which baffled those who sought solution aid their senses carry art however its highest
pitch necessary reasoner should able utilise facts which come knowledge itself implies will readily see possession knowledge which even these days free education encyclopaedias somewhat rare accomplishment impossible however man should possess knowledge
which likely useful him work endeavoured case remember rightly one
occasion early days friendship defined limits
very precise fashion
yes answered laughing singular document
philosophy astronomy politics marked zero remember botany variable geology profound regards mudstains any region within fifty miles town chemistry
eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature crime
records unique violinplayer boxer swordsman lawyer selfpoisoner cocaine tobacco those think main points analysis
holmes grinned last item well said say now said then man should keep little brainattic
stocked furniture likely use rest can put away lumberroom library where can get wants now such case one which
been submitted tonight need certainly muster
resources kindly hand down letter american encyclopaedia which stands upon shelf beside thank now let consider situation see what may deduced first place may start strong
presumption colonel openshaw had some very strong reason leaving america men time life change their
habits exchange willingly charming climate florida lonely life english provincial town extreme love
solitude england suggests idea fear someone something may assume working hypothesis
fear someone something which drove him america what feared can only deduce considering formidable letters which received himself
successors did remark postmarks those
letters
first pondicherry second dundee third london
east london what deduce they seaports writer board ship
excellent already clue there can doubt probabilitythe strong probabilityis writer board ship now let consider another point case pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between threat its fulfilment dundee only some three four days
does suggest anything
greater distance travel
letter had also greater distance come
then see point
there least presumption vessel which man
men sailingship looks they always send
their singular warning token before them when starting upon
their mission see quickly deed followed sign
when came dundee they had come pondicherry steamer they would arrived almost soon their letter
matter fact seven weeks elapsed think those
seven weeks represented difference between mailboat which
brought letter sailing vessel which brought writer
possible
more than probable now see deadly
urgency new case why urged young openshaw caution blow always fallen end time which
would take senders travel distance one
comes london therefore cannot count upon delay
good god cried what can mean relentless
persecution
papers which openshaw carried obviously vital
importance person persons sailingship think
quite clear there must more than one them
single man could carried out two deaths such way
deceive coroners jury there must been several they must been men resource determination
their papers they mean holder them who may
way see ceases initials individual becomes badge society
what society
never said sherlock holmes bending forward sinking voicehave never heard klux klan
never holmes turned over leaves book upon knee here said presently
klux klan name derived fanciful resemblance sound produced cocking rifle terrible secret
society formed some exconfederate soldiers southern states after civil war rapidly formed local
branches different parts country notably tennessee
louisiana carolinas georgia florida its power used political purposes principally terrorising negro voters murdering driving country
those who opposed its views its outrages usually
preceded warning sent marked man some fantastic
generally recognised shapea sprig oakleaves some
parts melon seeds orange pips others receiving victim might either openly abjure former ways might
fly country braved matter out death would
unfailingly come upon him usually some strange unforeseen manner perfect organisation society systematic its methods there hardly case upon record where any man succeeded braving impunity which any its outrages traced home perpetrators some years organisation flourished spite
efforts united states government better
classes community south eventually year
movement rather suddenly collapsed although there been sporadic outbreaks same sort since date
will observe said holmes laying down volume sudden breaking society coincident disappearance openshaw america their papers may
well been cause effect wonder family some more implacable spirits upon their track
can understand register diary may implicate
some first men south there may many
who will sleep easy night until recovered
then page seen
such might expect ran remember right sent
pips cthat sent societys warning them then there successive entries cleared left country finally visited fear sinister result well think doctor may let
some light into dark place believe only
chance young openshaw meantime what told him there nothing more said done
tonight hand over violin let try forget half hour miserable weather still more miserable
ways fellowmen
had cleared morning sun shining subdued brightness through dim veil which hangs over great city sherlock holmes already breakfast when came

through gloom one could dimly catch glimpse bodies lying
strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads
thrown back chins pointing upward here there dark lacklustre eye turned upon newcomer out black
shadows there glimmered little red circles light now bright
now faint burning poison waxed waned bowls metal pipes most lay silent some muttered themselves others talked together strange low
monotonous voice their conversation coming gushes then
suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out own

tall man who sat brazier felt sudden pluck skirt low voice whispered walk past then look
back words fell quite distinctly upon ear glanced down they could only come old man side yet sat now absorbed ever very thin very
wrinkled bent age opium pipe dangling down between
knees though had dropped sheer lassitude fingers took two steps forward looked back took selfcontrol prevent breaking out into cry astonishment had turned back none could see him
form had filled out wrinkles gone dull
eyes had regained their fire there sitting fire grinning surprise none other than sherlock holmes made slight motion approach him instantly turned face half round company once more subsided
into doddering looselipped senility
holmes whispered what earth doing den

where then
near lee kent sevenmile drive before dark
course youll know about presently jump here right john shall need heres half crown look out tomorrow about eleven give head long then
flicked horse whip dashed away through
endless succession sombre deserted streets which
widened gradually until flying across broad
balustraded bridge murky river flowing sluggishly
beneath beyond lay another dull wilderness bricks mortar its silence broken only heavy regular footfall policeman songs shouts some belated party revellers dull wrack drifting slowly across sky star two twinkled dimly here there through rifts clouds holmes drove silence head sunk upon breast air man who lost thought while sat
beside him curious learn what new quest might which
seemed tax powers sorely yet afraid break upon current thoughts had driven several miles
beginning get fringe belt suburban
villas when shook himself shrugged shoulders lit pipe air man who satisfied himself acting best
grand gift silence watson said makes
quite invaluable companion pon word great

little woman tonight when meets door
forget know nothing about shall just time tell facts case before
get lee seems absurdly simple yet somehow can
get nothing upon theres plenty thread doubt cant get end into hand now ill state case
clearly concisely watson maybe can see spark where dark proceed then
some years agoto definite may there came lee
gentleman neville clair name who appeared plenty money took large villa laid out grounds very
nicely lived generally good style degrees made
friends neighbourhood married daughter
local brewer whom now two children had occupation interested several companies went into
town rule morning returning cannon
street every night clair now thirtyseven years age man temperate habits good husband very
affectionate father man who popular who know
him may add whole debts present moment far
been able ascertain amount pounds while
pounds standing credit capital counties bank there reason therefore think money
troubles been weighing upon mind
last monday neville clair went into town rather earlier
than usual remarking before started had two important
commissions perform would bring little boy
home box bricks now merest chance wife
received telegram upon same monday very shortly after departure effect small parcel considerable
value which had been expecting waiting offices aberdeen shipping company now well london will know office company fresno street which branches out upper swandam lane where
found tonight mrs clair had lunch started city did some shopping proceeded companys office
got packet found herself exactly walking through
swandam lane way back station followed far
very clear
remember monday exceedingly hot day mrs clair walked slowly glancing about hope seeing cab
did like neighbourhood which found herself
while walking way down swandam lane suddenly
heard ejaculation cry struck cold see husband looking down seemed beckoning
secondfloor window window open distinctly saw face which describes being terribly
agitated waved hands frantically then
vanished window suddenly seemed had been plucked back some irresistible force behind
one singular point which struck quick feminine eye although wore some dark coat such had started town
had neither collar nor necktie
convinced something amiss him rushed down stepsfor house none other than opium den which
found tonightand running through front room attempted ascend stairs which led first floor foot stairs however met lascar scoundrel whom spoken who thrust back aided dane who
acts assistant there pushed out into street filled
most maddening doubts fears rushed down lane rare goodfortune met fresno street number constables inspector their way their beat inspector two men accompanied back spite continued resistance proprietor they made their way room which clair had last been seen there sign him there fact whole floor there one found save crippled wretch hideous aspect who
seems made home there both lascar stoutly
swore one else had been front room during afternoon determined their denial inspector staggered had almost come believe mrs clair had
been deluded when cry sprang small deal box
which lay upon table tore lid out there fell
cascade childrens bricks toy which had
promised bring home

showed made inspector realise matter serious

now villains who seemed immediately
implicated matter lascar known man vilest antecedents mrs clairs story known been foot stair within very few
seconds husbands appearance window could
hardly been more than accessory crime defence
one absolute ignorance protested had knowledge doings hugh boone lodger could account any way presence missing
gentlemans clothes
much lascar manager now sinister cripple who
lives upon second floor opium den who certainly last human being whose eyes rested upon neville clair name hugh boone hideous face one which
familiar every man who goes much city professional beggar though order avoid police
regulations pretends small trade wax vestas some
little distance down threadneedle street upon lefthand

crosslegged tiny stock matches lap piteous spectacle small rain charity descends into greasy leather cap which lies upon pavement beside him watched fellow more than once before ever thought making professional acquaintance been surprised
harvest which reaped short time appearance see remarkable one can pass him
without observing him shock orange hair pale face

surely medical experience would tell watson weakness one limb often compensated exceptional

pray continue narrative
mrs clair had fainted sight blood upon window escorted home cab police presence could help them their investigations
inspector barton who had charge case made very careful
examination premises without finding anything which
threw any light upon matter one mistake had been made arresting boone instantly allowed some few minutes

reached one said friend sitting upon five
pillows consuming ounce shag think watson drive baker street shall just time breakfast
vii adventure blue carbuncle
had called upon friend sherlock holmes upon second
morning after christmas intention wishing him compliments season lounging upon sofa purple dressinggown piperack within reach upon right pile crumpled morning papers evidently newly
studied near hand beside couch wooden chair angle back hung very seedy disreputable
hardfelt hat much worse wear cracked several
places lens forceps lying upon seat chair
suggested hat had been suspended manner purpose examination
engaged said perhaps interrupt glad friend whom can discuss
results matter perfectly trivial onehe jerked thumb direction old hatbut there points connection which entirely devoid interest even instruction
seated myself armchair warmed hands before crackling fire sharp frost had set windows
thick ice crystals suppose remarked homely looks thing some deadly story linked itthat clue which will guide solution some mystery punishment some crime
crime said sherlock holmes laughing only one those whimsical little incidents which will happen when four million human beings jostling each other within space few square miles amid action reaction dense swarm humanity every possible combination events
may expected take place many little problem will presented which may striking bizarre without being
criminal already had experience such
much remarked last six cases which added notes three been entirely free any
legal crime
precisely allude attempt recover irene adler
papers singular case miss mary sutherland adventure man twisted lip well doubt
small matter will fall into same innocent category
know peterson commissionaire
yes
him trophy belongs
hat
found its owner unknown beg will
look upon battered billycock intellectual
problem first came here arrived upon
christmas morning company good fat goose which doubt roasting moment front petersons
fire facts these about four oclock christmas
morning peterson who know very honest fellow returning some small jollification making way
homeward down tottenham court road front him saw gaslight tallish man walking slight stagger carrying white goose slung over shoulder reached corner goodge street row broke out between stranger
little knot roughs one latter knocked off mans hat which raised stick defend himself swinging over head smashed shop window behind him
peterson had rushed forward protect stranger assailants man shocked having broken window seeing officiallooking person uniform rushing towards him
dropped goose took heels vanished amid labyrinth small streets which lie back tottenham
court road roughs had also fled appearance peterson left possession field battle also spoils victory shape battered hat most unimpeachable christmas goose
which surely restored their owner
dear fellow there lies problem true mrs henry baker printed upon small card which tied birds left leg also true initials legible upon lining hat there some thousands bakers some hundreds henry bakers city ours easy restore lost property any
one them
what then did peterson brought round both hat goose christmas morning
knowing even smallest problems interest goose retained until morning when there signs
spite slight frost would well should eaten without unnecessary delay its finder carried
off therefore fulfil ultimate destiny goose
while continue retain hat unknown gentleman who
lost christmas dinner
did advertise
then what clue could identity
only much can deduce
hat
precisely
joking what can gather old battered
felt
here lens know methods what can gather
yourself individuality man who worn article
took tattered object hands turned over rather
ruefully very ordinary black hat usual round
shape hard much worse wear lining had been red silk good deal discoloured there makers
name holmes had remarked initials scrawled upon one side pierced brim hatsecurer elastic missing rest cracked exceedingly dusty spotted several places
although there seemed been some attempt hide discoloured patches smearing them ink
can see nothing said handing back friend
contrary watson can see everything fail
however reason what see too timid drawing inferences
then pray tell what can infer hat
picked gazed peculiar introspective
fashion which characteristic him perhaps less
suggestive than might been remarked yet there
few inferences which very distinct few others
which represent least strong balance probability man highly intellectual course obvious upon face also fairly welltodo within last three years although now fallen upon evil days had foresight less now than formerly pointing moral retrogression which when taken decline fortunes seems indicate some evil influence probably drink
work upon him may account also obvious fact wife ceased love him
dear holmes
however retained some degree selfrespect continued disregarding remonstrance man who leads sedentary life goes out little out training entirely middleaged grizzled hair which had cut within last few days which anoints limecream these more patent facts which deduced hat also
way extremely improbable gas laid
house
certainly joking holmes
least possible even now when give these results unable see they attained
doubt very stupid must confess unable follow example did deduce man intellectual
answer holmes clapped hat upon head came right
over forehead settled upon bridge nose question cubic capacity said man large brain must something decline fortunes then
hat three years old these flat brims curled edge
came then hat very best quality look band ribbed silk excellent lining man could
afford buy expensive hat three years ago had hat since then assuredly gone down world
well clear enough certainly about foresight moral retrogression
sherlock holmes laughed here foresight said putting
finger upon little disc loop hatsecurer
they never sold upon hats man ordered one sign certain amount foresight since went out way take precaution against wind since see
broken elastic troubled replace
obvious less foresight now than formerly
which distinct proof weakening nature other
hand endeavoured conceal some these stains upon felt daubing them ink which sign entirely lost selfrespect
reasoning certainly plausible
further points middleaged hair grizzled been recently cut uses
limecream gathered close examination lower part lining lens discloses large number hairends clean cut scissors barber they appear adhesive there distinct odour limecream dust will observe gritty grey
dust street fluffy brown dust house
showing been hung indoors most time while
marks moisture upon inside proof positive wearer perspired very freely could therefore hardly best training
wifeyou said had ceased love him
hat been brushed weeks when see dear
watson weeks accumulation dust upon hat when wife allows out such state shall fear
also been unfortunate enough lose wifes
affection
might bachelor
nay bringing home goose peaceoffering wife remember card upon birds leg
answer everything earth deduce
gas laid house
one tallow stain even two might come chance when see less than five think there can little doubt
individual must brought into frequent contact burning tallowwalks upstairs night probably hat one hand guttering candle other anyhow never
got tallowstains gasjet satisfied
well very ingenious said laughing since said just now there been crime committed harm
done save loss goose seems rather waste energy
sherlock holmes had opened mouth reply when door flew
open peterson commissionaire rushed into apartment
flushed cheeks face man who dazed astonishment

another investigation which also bird will chief
feature
viii adventure speckled band
glancing over notes seventy odd cases which during last eight years studied methods friend
sherlock holmes find many tragic some comic large number
merely strange none commonplace working did
rather love art than acquirement wealth refused associate himself any investigation
which did tend towards unusual even fantastic
these varied cases however cannot recall any which
presented more singular features than which associated
wellknown surrey family roylotts stoke moran
events question occurred early days association holmes when sharing rooms bachelors
baker street possible might placed them
upon record before promise secrecy made time which only been freed during last month untimely death lady whom pledge given perhaps well facts should now come light reasons know there widespread rumours death grimesby roylott which tend make matter even
more terrible than truth
early april year woke one morning find sherlock holmes standing fully dressed side bed late riser rule clock mantelpiece showed only quarterpast seven blinked him some surprise perhaps just little
resentment myself regular habits
very sorry knock watson said its common lot morning mrs hudson been knocked retorted upon what thena fire
client seems young lady arrived considerable state excitement who insists upon seeing waiting now sittingroom now when young ladies wander
about metropolis hour morning knock
sleepy people out their beds presume something very pressing which they communicate should prove interesting case would sure wish follow outset thought any rate should
call give chance
dear fellow would miss anything
had keener pleasure than following holmes professional investigations admiring rapid
deductions swift intuitions yet always founded logical basis which unravelled problems which submitted him rapidly threw clothes ready few minutes accompany friend down sittingroom lady dressed black heavily veiled who had been sitting window rose entered
goodmorning madam said holmes cheerily name sherlock

what then
fear holmes terror raised veil spoke could see indeed pitiable
state agitation face drawn grey restless
frightened eyes like those some hunted animal features

holmes turned desk unlocking drew out small
casebook which consulted
farintosh said yes recall case concerned opal tiara think before time
watson can only say madam shall happy devote
same care case did friend reward profession its own reward liberty
defray whatever expenses may put time which
suits best now beg will lay before everything may help forming opinion upon matter
alas replied visitor very horror situation
lies fact fears vague suspicions
depend entirely upon small points which might seem trivial another even whom others right look help advice looks upon tell him about fancies nervous woman does say can
read soothing answers averted eyes heard holmes can see deeply into manifold
wickedness human heart may advise walk amid
dangers which encompass attention madam
name helen stoner living stepfather who
last survivor one oldest saxon families england roylotts stoke moran western border surrey
holmes nodded head name familiar said family one time among richest england estates extended over borders into berkshire north
hampshire west last century however four
successive heirs dissolute wasteful disposition
family ruin eventually completed gambler days regency nothing left save few acres ground
twohundredyearold house which itself crushed under
heavy mortgage last squire dragged out existence
there living horrible life aristocratic pauper only son stepfather seeing must adapt himself new conditions obtained advance relative which
enabled him take medical degree went out calcutta
where professional skill force character established large practice fit anger however caused
some robberies which had been perpetrated house beat native butler death narrowly escaped capital
sentence suffered long term imprisonment afterwards returned england morose disappointed man
when roylott india married mother mrs stoner
young widow majorgeneral stoner bengal artillery
sister julia twins only two years old

provision certain annual sum should allowed each event marriage shortly after return
england mother diedshe killed eight years ago railway accident near crewe roylott then abandoned attempts establish himself practice london took live him old ancestral house stoke moran money which mother had left enough wants there seemed obstacle happiness
terrible change came over stepfather about time
instead making friends exchanging visits neighbours who had first been overjoyed see roylott stoke moran back old family seat shut himself house seldom came out save indulge ferocious
quarrels whoever might cross path violence temper
approaching mania been hereditary men family stepfathers case had believe been
intensified long residence tropics series disgraceful brawls took place two which ended policecourt until last became terror village
folks would fly approach man immense strength absolutely uncontrollable anger
last week hurled local blacksmith over parapet into stream only paying over money which could gather together able avert another public
exposure had friends save wandering gipsies
would give these vagabonds leave encamp upon few
acres bramblecovered land which represent family estate
would accept return hospitality their tents
wandering away them sometimes weeks end passion also indian animals which sent over him correspondent moment cheetah baboon
which wander freely over grounds feared villagers almost much their master
can imagine what say poor sister julia had great pleasure lives servant would stay long time did work house thirty time death yet hair had already
begun whiten even mine sister dead then
died just two years ago death wish
speak can understand living life which described little likely see anyone own
age position had however aunt mothers maiden
sister miss honoria westphail who lives near harrow occasionally allowed pay short visits ladys
house julia went there christmas two years ago met there
halfpay major marines whom became engaged stepfather learned engagement when sister returned offered objection marriage within fortnight day which had been fixed wedding terrible event
occurred which deprived only companion
sherlock holmes had been leaning back chair eyes
closed head sunk cushion half opened lids now glanced across visitor
pray precise details said easy every event dreadful
time seared into memory manorhouse already said very old only one wing now inhabited bedrooms wing ground floor sittingrooms
being central block buildings these bedrooms
first roylotts second sisters third
own there communication between them they open
out into same corridor make myself plain
perfectly windows three rooms open out upon lawn fatal night roylott had gone room early though knew had retired rest sister troubled
smell strong indian cigars which custom
smoke left room therefore came into mine where
sat some time chatting about approaching wedding eleven oclock rose leave paused door
looked back
tell helen said ever heard anyone whistle
dead night
never said suppose could possibly whistle yourself sleep
certainly why
because during last few nights always about three
morning heard low clear whistle light sleeper
awakened cannot tell where came fromperhaps
next room perhaps lawn thought would
just ask whether had heard must those wretched gipsies plantation
very likely yet lawn wonder did hear also
sleep more heavily than well great consequence any rate smiled
back closed door few moments later heard key turn lock
indeed said holmes custom always lock
yourselves night
always
why
think mentioned doctor kept cheetah
baboon had feeling security unless doors locked
quite pray proceed statement
could sleep night vague feeling impending
misfortune impressed sister will recollect
twins know subtle links which bind two
souls which closely allied wild night wind
howling outside rain beating splashing
against windows suddenly amid hubbub gale
there burst forth wild scream terrified woman knew
sisters voice sprang bed wrapped shawl round rushed into corridor opened door
seemed hear low whistle such sister described few moments later clanging sound mass metal had
fallen ran down passage sisters door unlocked
revolved slowly upon its hinges stared horrorstricken knowing what about issue light corridorlamp saw sister appear opening face blanched terror hands groping help whole figure swaying fro like drunkard ran threw arms round moment knees seemed give way fell ground
writhed one who terrible pain limbs dreadfully convulsed first thought had recognised bent over suddenly shrieked out
voice which shall never forget god helen band speckled band there something else which would fain said stabbed finger into air direction doctors room fresh convulsion
seized choked words rushed out calling loudly stepfather met him hastening room dressinggown when reached sisters side unconscious though poured brandy down throat sent
medical aid village efforts vain slowly sank died without having recovered consciousness such dreadful end beloved sister
one moment said holmes sure about whistle metallic sound could swear what county coroner asked inquiry strong impression heard yet among crash gale creaking old house may possibly been deceived
sister dressed
nightdress right hand found charred stump match left matchbox
showing had struck light looked about when
alarm took place important what conclusions did
coroner come investigated case great care roylotts
conduct had long been notorious county unable
find any satisfactory cause death evidence showed door had been fastened upon inner side windows
blocked oldfashioned shutters broad iron bars
which secured every night walls carefully sounded
shown quite solid round flooring also thoroughly examined same result chimney wide barred four large staples certain
therefore sister quite alone when met end
besides there marks any violence upon about poison
doctors examined without success
what think unfortunate lady died then
belief died pure fear nervous shock
though what frightened cannot imagine
there gipsies plantation time
yes there nearly always some there
what did gather allusion banda
speckled band
sometimes thought merely wild talk delirium sometimes may referred some band people perhaps these very gipsies plantation know whether spotted handkerchiefs which many them wear
over their heads might suggested strange adjective which
used
holmes shook head like man who far being satisfied
these very deep waters said pray narrative
two years passed since then life been until
lately lonelier than ever month ago however dear friend
whom known many years done honour ask
hand marriage name armitagepercy armitagethe
second son armitage crane water near reading stepfather offered opposition match married course spring two days ago some repairs
started west wing building bedroom
wall been pierced had move into chamber which sister died sleep very bed which slept imagine then thrill terror when last
night lay awake thinking over terrible fate suddenly heard silence night low whistle which
had been herald own death sprang lit lamp nothing seen room too shaken bed again however dressed soon daylight slipped down got dogcart crown inn which
opposite drove leatherhead whence come morning one object seeing asking advice
done wisely said friend told yes miss roylott screening stepfather
why what mean
answer holmes pushed back frill black lace which
fringed hand lay upon visitors knee five little
livid spots marks four fingers thumb printed
upon white wrist
been cruelly used said holmes
lady coloured deeply covered over injured wrist hard man said perhaps hardly knows own
strength
there long silence during which holmes leaned chin
upon hands stared into crackling fire
very deep business said last there thousand details which should desire know before decide
upon course action yet moment lose come stoke moran today would possible see over these rooms without knowledge stepfather
happens spoke coming into town today upon some
most important business probable will away day there would nothing disturb housekeeper now old foolish could easily
get out way
excellent averse trip watson
means
then shall both come what going yourself
one two things which would wish now town shall return twelve oclock train there time coming
may expect early afternoon myself some
small business matters attend will wait breakfast
must heart lightened already since confided trouble shall look forward seeing again afternoon dropped thick black veil over face glided room
what think watson asked sherlock holmes
leaning back chair
seems most dark sinister business
dark enough sinister enough
yet lady correct saying flooring walls
sound door window chimney impassable
then sister must been undoubtedly alone when met mysterious end
what becomes then these nocturnal whistles what very peculiar words dying woman
cannot think
when combine ideas whistles night presence band gipsies who intimate terms old doctor
fact every reason believe doctor interest preventing stepdaughters marriage dying
allusion band finally fact miss helen stoner
heard metallic clang which might been caused one those metal bars secured shutters falling back into its
place think there good ground think mystery may cleared along those lines
what then did gipsies cannot imagine
see many objections any such theory
precisely reason going
stoke moran day want see whether objections fatal they may explained away what name devil
ejaculation had been drawn companion fact door had been suddenly dashed open huge man had
framed himself aperture costume peculiar
mixture professional agricultural having black tophat long frockcoat pair high gaiters
huntingcrop swinging hand tall hat actually brushed cross bar doorway breadth seemed span across side side large face
seared thousand wrinkles burned yellow sun marked every evil passion turned one other
while deepset bileshot eyes high thin
fleshless nose gave him somewhat resemblance fierce old
bird prey
which holmes asked apparition
name sir advantage said companion quietly
grimesby roylott stoke moran
indeed doctor said holmes blandly pray take seat
will nothing kind stepdaughter been here traced what been saying little cold time year said holmes
what been saying screamed old man
furiously
heard crocuses promise well continued companion imperturbably
put off said new visitor taking step
forward shaking huntingcrop know scoundrel
heard before holmes meddler
friend smiled
holmes busybody
smile broadened
holmes scotland yard jackinoffice
holmes chuckled heartily conversation most
entertaining said when out close door there decided draught
will when said say dont dare meddle affairs know miss stoner been here traced dangerous man fall foul see here stepped
swiftly forward seized poker bent into curve huge brown hands
see keep yourself out grip snarled hurling twisted poker into fireplace strode out room
seems very amiable person said holmes laughing quite bulky had remained might shown him
grip much more feeble than own spoke
picked steel poker sudden effort
straightened out again
fancy having insolence confound official
detective force incident gives zest investigation
however only trust little friend will suffer
imprudence allowing brute trace now
watson shall order breakfast afterwards shall walk
down doctors commons where hope get some data which may
help matter
nearly one oclock when sherlock holmes returned excursion held hand sheet blue paper scrawled
over notes figures
seen will deceased wife said determine its exact meaning been obliged work out present prices investments which concerned total income which time wifes death little
short pounds now through fall agricultural
prices more than pounds each daughter can claim income pounds case marriage evident
therefore both girls had married beauty would had mere pittance while even one them would cripple him very serious extent mornings work been wasted
since proved very strongest motives standing way anything sort now watson
too serious dawdling especially old man aware interesting ourselves affairs ready shall call cab drive waterloo should very much obliged would slip revolver into pocket eleys excellent argument gentlemen
who can twist steel pokers into knots toothbrush
think need
waterloo fortunate catching train leatherhead where hired trap station inn drove
four five miles through lovely surrey lanes perfect day bright sun few fleecy clouds heavens trees wayside hedges just throwing out
their first green shoots air full pleasant
smell moist earth least there strange
contrast between sweet promise spring sinister quest upon which engaged companion sat front trap arms folded hat pulled down over
eyes chin sunk upon breast buried deepest thought suddenly however started tapped shoulder pointed over meadows
look there said heavily timbered park stretched gentle slope
thickening into grove highest point amid branches there jutted out grey gables high rooftree very old mansion
stoke moran said yes sir house grimesby roylott remarked
driver
there some building going there said holmes where going
theres village said driver pointing cluster roofs some distance left want get house youll find shorter get over stile footpath over fields there where lady walking
lady fancy miss stoner observed holmes shading
eyes yes think had better suggest
got off paid fare trap rattled back its way
leatherhead
thought well said holmes climbed stile
fellow should think had come here architects some definite business may stop gossip
goodafternoon miss stoner see been good word
client morning had hurried forward meet face which spoke joy been waiting eagerly cried shaking hands warmly turned
out splendidly roylott gone town unlikely
will back before evening
had pleasure making doctors acquaintance
said holmes few words sketched out what had
occurred miss stoner turned white lips listened
good heavens cried followed then
appears
cunning never know when safe him what
will say when returns
must guard himself may find there someone
more cunning than himself upon track must lock yourself
him tonight violent shall take away aunts harrow now must make best use time kindly take once rooms which examine
building grey lichenblotched stone high
central portion two curving wings like claws crab
thrown out each side one these wings windows broken blocked wooden boards while roof partly
caved picture ruin central portion little
better repair righthand block comparatively modern
blinds windows blue smoke curling chimneys showed where family resided
some scaffolding had been erected against end wall stonework had been broken into there signs any
workmen moment visit holmes walked slowly down illtrimmed lawn examined deep attention outsides windows
take belongs room which used sleep
centre one sisters one next main
building roylotts chamber
exactly now sleeping middle one
pending alterations understand way there does
seem any very pressing need repairs end
wall
there none believe excuse move room
suggestive now other side narrow
wing runs corridor which these three rooms open there
windows course
yes very small ones too narrow anyone pass
through
both locked doors night rooms unapproachable side now would kindness
into room bar shutters
miss stoner did holmes after careful examination
through open window endeavoured every way force shutter open without success there slit through
which knife could passed raise bar then lens tested hinges they solid iron built
firmly into massive masonry hum said scratching chin some perplexity theory certainly presents some
difficulties one could pass these shutters they bolted well shall see inside throws any light upon
matter
small side door led into whitewashed corridor which
three bedrooms opened holmes refused examine third
chamber passed once second which miss
stoner now sleeping which sister had met fate homely little room low ceiling gaping fireplace after fashion old countryhouses brown chest drawers stood one corner narrow
whitecounterpaned bed another dressingtable lefthand side window these articles two small
wickerwork chairs made furniture room save
square wilton carpet centre boards round panelling walls brown wormeaten oak old
discoloured may dated original building
house holmes drew one chairs into corner sat
silent while eyes travelled round round down
taking every detail apartment
where does bell communicate asked last
pointing thick bellrope which hung down beside bed tassel actually lying upon pillow
goes housekeepers room
looks newer than other things
yes only put there couple years ago
sister asked suppose
never heard using used always get what wanted ourselves
indeed seemed unnecessary put nice bellpull there
will excuse few minutes while satisfy myself floor threw himself down upon face lens hand crawled swiftly backward forward examining
minutely cracks between boards then did same woodwork which chamber panelled finally walked over bed spent some time staring running eye down wall finally took bellrope hand gave brisk tug
why its dummy said wont ring
even attached wire very interesting
can see now fastened hook just above where
little opening ventilator very absurd never noticed before
very strange muttered holmes pulling rope there one two very singular points about room example
what fool builder must open ventilator into another
room when same trouble might communicated
outside air
also quite modern said lady
done about same time bellrope remarked holmes
yes there several little changes carried out about time
they seem been most interesting characterdummy
bellropes ventilators which ventilate permission miss stoner shall now carry researches into
inner apartment
grimesby roylotts chamber larger than stepdaughter plainly furnished campbed small
wooden shelf full books mostly technical character armchair beside bed plain wooden chair against wall round table large iron safe principal things
which met eye holmes walked slowly round examined each
them keenest interest
whats here asked tapping safe
stepfathers business papers
seen inside then
only once some years ago remember full papers
there isnt cat example
what strange idea
well look took small saucer milk which
stood top dont keep cat there cheetah baboon
yes course well cheetah just big cat yet saucer milk does very far satisfying its wants daresay there one point which should wish determine squatted down front wooden chair examined seat
greatest attention
thank quite settled said rising putting
lens pocket hullo here something interesting
object which had caught eye small dog lash hung one corner bed lash however curled upon itself
tied make loop whipcord
what make watson
its common enough lash dont know why should tied
quite common its wicked world
when clever man turns brains crime worst
think seen enough now miss stoner permission shall walk out upon lawn
had never seen friends face grim brow dark when turned scene investigation had walked several times down lawn neither miss
stoner nor myself liking break upon thoughts before roused himself reverie
very essential miss stoner said should
absolutely follow advice every respect
shall most certainly matter too serious any hesitation life may
depend upon compliance
assure hands
first place both friend must spend night room
both miss stoner gazed him astonishment
yes must let explain believe village inn over there
yes crown
very good windows would visible there
certainly
must confine yourself room pretence headache when stepfather comes back then when hear him
retire night must open shutters window
undo hasp put lamp there signal then
withdraw quietly everything which likely want
into room which used occupy doubt spite repairs could manage there one night
yes easily
rest will leave hands
what will shall spend night room shall investigate
cause noise which disturbed believe holmes already made mind
said miss stoner laying hand upon companions sleeve
perhaps then pitys sake tell what cause sisters
death
should prefer clearer proofs before speak
can least tell whether own thought correct died some sudden fright
think think there probably some more
tangible cause now miss stoner must leave roylott returned saw journey would vain
goodbye brave will what told may rest assured shall soon drive away dangers
threaten sherlock holmes had difficulty engaging bedroom sittingroom crown inn they upper floor window could command view avenue gate inhabited wing stoke moran manor house dusk saw
grimesby roylott drive past huge form looming beside
little figure lad who drove him boy had some
slight difficulty undoing heavy iron gates heard
hoarse roar doctors voice saw fury which
shook clinched fists him trap drove few
minutes later saw sudden light spring among trees lamp lit one sittingrooms
know watson said holmes sat together gathering darkness really some scruples taking tonight there distinct element danger
can assistance
presence might invaluable
then shall certainly come
very kind speak danger evidently seen more these rooms
than visible fancy may deduced little more imagine
saw did
saw nothing remarkable save bellrope what purpose
could answer confess more than can imagine
saw ventilator too
yes think such very unusual thing small opening between two rooms small rat could hardly pass through
knew should find ventilator before ever came stoke moran
dear holmes
yes did remember statement said sister could smell roylotts cigar now course suggested once there must communication between two rooms could only small one would been
remarked upon coroners inquiry deduced ventilator
what harm can there well there least curious coincidence dates ventilator made cord hung lady who sleeps bed dies does strike cannot yet see any connection
did observe anything very peculiar about bed
clamped floor did ever see bed fastened
like before
cannot say lady could move bed must always same
relative position ventilator ropeor may
call since clearly never meant bellpull
holmes cried seem see dimly what hinting only just time prevent some subtle horrible
crime
subtle enough horrible enough when doctor does wrong
first criminals nerve knowledge
palmer pritchard among heads their profession
man strikes even deeper think watson shall
able strike deeper still shall horrors enough
before night over goodness sake let quiet
pipe turn minds few hours something more
cheerful
about nine oclock light among trees extinguished
dark direction manor house two hours
passed slowly away then suddenly just stroke eleven single bright light shone out right front signal said holmes springing feet comes middle window
passed out exchanged few words landlord
explaining going late visit acquaintance
possible might spend night there moment later out dark road chill wind blowing
faces one yellow light twinkling front through gloom guide sombre errand
there little difficulty entering grounds unrepaired breaches gaped old park wall making way
among trees reached lawn crossed about
enter through window when out clump laurel
bushes there darted what seemed hideous distorted
child who threw itself upon grass writhing limbs then ran swiftly across lawn into darkness
god whispered did see holmes moment startled hand closed like
vice upon wrist agitation then broke into low
laugh put lips ear
nice household murmured baboon
had forgotten strange pets which doctor affected there
cheetah too perhaps might find upon shoulders
any moment confess felt easier mind when
after following holmes example slipping off shoes found myself inside bedroom companion noiselessly closed
shutters moved lamp onto table cast eyes
round room had seen daytime then
creeping making trumpet hand whispered
into ear again gently could distinguish words
least sound would fatal plans
nodded show had heard
must sit without light would see through ventilator
nodded again
asleep very life may depend upon pistol ready case should need will sit side bed chair
took out revolver laid corner table
holmes had brought long thin cane placed upon
bed beside him laid box matches stump candle then turned down lamp left
darkness
shall ever forget dreadful vigil could hear sound even drawing breath yet knew companion sat openeyed within few feet same
state nervous tension which myself shutters cut
off least ray light waited absolute darkness
outside came occasional cry nightbird once very window long drawn catlike whine which told cheetah indeed liberty far away could hear deep tones parish clock which boomed out every quarter hour long they seemed those quarters twelve struck one two three still sat waiting silently whatever might befall
suddenly there momentary gleam light direction ventilator which vanished immediately succeeded strong smell burning oil heated metal
someone next room had lit darklantern heard gentle
sound movement then silent once more though smell grew stronger half hour sat straining ears
then suddenly another sound became audiblea very gentle
soothing sound like small jet steam escaping
continually kettle instant heard holmes
sprang bed struck match lashed furiously cane bellpull
see watson yelled see saw nothing moment when holmes struck light heard low clear whistle sudden glare flashing into weary eyes made impossible tell what which
friend lashed savagely could however see face
deadly pale filled horror loathing had
ceased strike gazing ventilator when
suddenly there broke silence night most
horrible cry which ever listened swelled louder
louder hoarse yell pain fear anger mingled
one dreadful shriek they say away down village even distant parsonage cry raised sleepers their beds struck cold hearts stood gazing holmes until last echoes had died away into silence which rose
what can mean gasped
means over holmes answered perhaps
after best take pistol will
enter roylotts room
grave face lit lamp led way down corridor twice struck chamber door without any reply
within then turned handle entered heels cocked pistol hand
singular sight which met eyes table stood darklantern shutter half open throwing brilliant
beam light upon iron safe door which ajar
beside table wooden chair sat grimesby roylott
clad long grey dressinggown bare ankles protruding
beneath feet thrust into red heelless turkish slippers
across lap lay short stock long lash which had noticed during day chin cocked upward eyes fixed dreadful rigid stare corner ceiling round brow had peculiar yellow band brownish speckles which seemed bound tightly round head entered made neither sound nor motion
band speckled band whispered holmes
took step forward instant strange headgear began
move there reared itself among hair squat
diamondshaped head puffed neck loathsome serpent
swamp adder cried holmes deadliest snake india died within ten seconds being bitten violence
does truth recoil upon violent schemer falls
into pit which digs another let thrust creature back into its den can then remove miss stoner some place shelter let county police know what happened
spoke drew dogwhip swiftly dead mans lap
throwing noose round reptiles neck drew its horrid perch carrying arms length threw into
iron safe which closed upon such true facts death grimesby roylott stoke moran necessary should prolong narrative which already run too great length telling
broke sad news terrified girl conveyed
morning train care good aunt harrow
slow process official inquiry came conclusion doctor met fate while indiscreetly
playing dangerous pet little which had yet learn
case told sherlock holmes travelled back
next day
had said come entirely erroneous conclusion which
shows dear watson dangerous always reason insufficient data presence gipsies use word band which used poor girl doubt explain appearance which had caught hurried glimpse light match sufficient put upon entirely wrong scent can only claim merit instantly
reconsidered position when however became clear whatever danger threatened occupant room could come either window door attention speedily drawn already remarked ventilator bellrope which hung down bed discovery dummy bed clamped floor instantly gave rise suspicion rope there bridge something passing through hole coming bed idea snake instantly occurred when coupled knowledge doctor furnished supply creatures india felt probably right track idea using form poison which could possibly discovered any chemical
test just such one would occur clever ruthless
man who had had eastern training rapidity which such
poison would take effect would also point view advantage would sharpeyed coroner indeed who could
distinguish two little dark punctures which would show where
poison fangs had done their work then thought whistle course must recall snake before morning
light revealed victim had trained probably use milk which saw return him when summoned
would put through ventilator hour thought best certainty would crawl down rope land bed might might bite occupant perhaps might escape every night week sooner later must fall victim
had come these conclusions before ever had entered room inspection chair showed had been habit standing which course would necessary
order should reach ventilator sight safe saucer milk loop whipcord enough finally dispel any doubts which may remained metallic
clang heard miss stoner obviously caused stepfather
hastily closing door safe upon its terrible occupant
having once made mind know steps which took order put matter proof heard creature hiss
doubt did also instantly lit light attacked result driving through ventilator
also result causing turn upon its master
other side some blows cane came home roused its snakish temper flew upon first person
saw way doubt indirectly responsible grimesby roylotts death cannot say likely weigh very heavily upon conscience
adventure engineers thumb
problems which been submitted friend sherlock holmes solution during years intimacy
there only two which means introducing noticethat hatherleys thumb colonel

summer long after marriage events occurred which now about summarise had returned

monotonous occupation
night could called monotonous said laughed laughed very heartily high ringing note
leaning back chair shaking sides medical
instincts rose against laugh
stop cried pull yourself together poured out
some water caraffe
useless however off one those hysterical
outbursts which come upon strong nature when some great crisis
over gone presently came himself once more very
weary palelooking

good heavens cried terrible injury must bled considerably
yes did fainted when done think must
been senseless long time when came found still bleeding tied one end handkerchief very
tightly round wrist braced twig
excellent should been surgeon
question hydraulics see came within own
province
been done said examining wound very
heavy sharp instrument
thing like cleaver said accident presume
means
what murderous attack
very murderous indeed
horrify sponged wound cleaned dressed finally covered
over cotton wadding carbolised bandages lay back
without wincing though bit lip time time
asked when had finished
capital between brandy bandage feel new man
very weak had good deal through
perhaps had better speak matter evidently
trying nerves
now shall tell tale police
between ourselves convincing

believed statement very extraordinary one much way proof which back even they believe clues which can give them vague question whether justice will done
cried anything nature problem
which desire see solved should strongly recommend come friend sherlock holmes before official police
heard fellow answered visitor should very glad would take matter though course must use official police well would give introduction him
ill better ill take round him myself
should immensely obliged well call cab together shall just time little breakfast him feel equal yes shall feel easy until told story
then servant will call cab shall instant rushed upstairs explained matter shortly wife five minutes inside hansom driving new acquaintance baker street
sherlock holmes expected lounging about sittingroom dressinggown reading agony column times smoking beforebreakfast pipe which composed
plugs dottles left smokes day
before carefully dried collected corner mantelpiece received quietly genial fashion
ordered fresh rashers eggs joined hearty meal
when concluded settled new acquaintance upon sofa placed pillow beneath head laid glass brandy water within reach
easy see experience been common one
hatherley said pray lie down there make yourself
absolutely home tell what can stop when tired keep strength little stimulant
thank said patient felt another man since
doctor bandaged think breakfast completed cure shall take little valuable
time possible shall start once upon peculiar
experiences
holmes sat big armchair weary heavylidded
expression which veiled keen eager nature while sat
opposite him listened silence strange story
which visitor detailed must know said orphan bachelor
residing alone lodgings london profession hydraulic engineer had considerable experience work during seven years apprenticed venner matheson wellknown firm greenwich two years ago
having served time having also come into fair sum money through poor fathers death determined start business myself took professional chambers victoria
street
suppose everyone finds first independent start business dreary experience been exceptionally during two years had three consultations one small
job absolutely profession brought
gross takings amount pounds every day nine morning until four afternoon waited little den until last heart began sink came believe should never any practice yesterday however just thinking leaving office clerk entered say there gentleman waiting who
wished see upon business brought card too name colonel lysander stark engraved upon close heels came colonel himself man rather over middle
size exceeding thinness think ever seen thin man whole face sharpened away into nose
chin skin cheeks drawn quite tense over
outstanding bones yet emaciation seemed natural habit due disease eye bright step brisk bearing assured plainly neatly
dressed age should judge would nearer forty than
thirty
hatherley said something german accent
been recommended hatherley being man
who only proficient profession also discreet
capable preserving secret
bowed feeling flattered any young man would such address may ask who who gave good character
well perhaps better should tell just
moment same source both
orphan bachelor residing alone london
quite correct answered will excuse say cannot see bears upon professional
qualifications understand professional matter
wished speak undoubtedly will find say really point professional commission absolute
secrecy quite essentialabsolute secrecy understand course may expect more man who alone than
one who lives bosom family
promise keep secret said may absolutely
depend upon doing looked very hard spoke seemed had never seen suspicious questioning eye
promise then said last
yes promise
absolute complete silence before during after reference matter either word writing
already given word
very good suddenly sprang darting like lightning
across room flung open door passage outside empty
thats right said coming back know clerks sometimes curious their masters affairs now can talk
safety drew chair very close mine began stare again same questioning thoughtful look
feeling repulsion something akin fear had begun
rise within strange antics fleshless man
even dread losing client could restrain showing impatience
beg will state business sir said time
value heaven forgive last sentence words came lips
would fifty guineas nights work suit asked
most admirably
say nights work hours would nearer mark simply want opinion about hydraulic stamping machine which
got out gear show what wrong shall soon
set right ourselves what think such commission work appears light pay munificent
precisely shall want come tonight last
train
where eyford berkshire little place near borders
oxfordshire within seven miles reading there train paddington which would bring there about
very good
shall come down carriage meet there drive then
yes little place quite out country good
seven miles eyford station
then can hardly get there before midnight suppose there
would chance train back should compelled stop
night
yes could easily give shakedown
very awkward could come some more convenient
hour
judged best should come late recompense any inconvenience paying young unknown man fee which would buy opinion very heads profession still course would
like draw out business there plenty time thought fifty guineas very useful they
would said shall very happy accommodate myself wishes should like however understand little more clearly what wish quite very natural pledge secrecy which
exacted should aroused curiosity wish commit anything without having laid before suppose absolutely safe eavesdroppers
entirely
then matter stands thus probably aware fullersearth valuable product only found
one two places england
heard some little time ago bought small placea very small
placewithin ten miles reading fortunate enough discover there deposit fullersearth one fields examining however found deposit comparatively small one formed link between two
very much larger ones upon right leftboth them
however grounds neighbours these good people absolutely ignorant their land contained which quite valuable goldmine naturally interest buy their land before they discovered its true value
unfortunately had capital which could took few friends into secret however they
suggested should quietly secretly work own little
deposit way should earn money which would
enable buy neighbouring fields now been
doing some time order help operations erected hydraulic press press already
explained got out order wish advice upon subject guard secret very jealously however once became known had hydraulic engineers coming little house would soon rouse inquiry then facts
came out would goodbye any chance getting these
fields carrying out plans why made promise will tell human being going eyford tonight hope make plain
quite follow said only point which could quite understand what use could make hydraulic press
excavating fullersearth which understand dug out
like gravel pit
said carelessly own process compress
earth into bricks remove them without revealing
what they mere detail taken fully
into confidence now hatherley shown trust rose spoke shall expect then eyford shall certainly there
word soul looked last long
questioning gaze then pressing hand cold dank
grasp hurried room
well when came think over cool blood very
much astonished may both think sudden commission
which had been intrusted one hand course glad fee least tenfold what should asked
had set price upon own services possible order might lead other ones other hand face
manner patron had made unpleasant impression upon
could think explanation fullersearth sufficient explain necessity coming midnight extreme anxiety lest should tell
anyone errand however threw fears winds ate
hearty supper drove paddington started off having
obeyed letter injunction holding tongue
reading had change only carriage station
however time last train eyford reached little dimlit station after eleven oclock only passenger who got out there there one upon platform save single sleepy porter lantern passed
out through wicket gate however found acquaintance morning waiting shadow upon other side without word grasped arm hurried into carriage door
which standing open drew windows either
side tapped woodwork away went fast horse could one horse interjected holmes
yes only one
did observe colour
yes saw sidelights when stepping into carriage chestnut
tiredlooking fresh
fresh glossy
thank sorry interrupted pray continue
most interesting statement
away went then drove least hour colonel
lysander stark had said only seven miles should think rate seemed time took must been nearer twelve sat
side silence time aware more than
once when glanced direction looking great intensity country roads seem very good
part world lurched jolted terribly tried look out windows see something where they made frosted glass could make out
nothing save occasional bright blur passing light now
then hazarded some remark break monotony journey colonel answered only monosyllables conversation soon flagged last however bumping road exchanged crisp smoothness graveldrive
carriage came stand colonel lysander stark sprang
out followed after him pulled swiftly into porch
which gaped front stepped right out carriage into hall failed catch most fleeting glance front house instant had crossed threshold door slammed heavily behind heard faintly rattle wheels carriage
drove away
pitch dark inside house colonel fumbled
about looking matches muttering under breath
suddenly door opened other end passage long golden bar light shot out direction grew
broader woman appeared lamp hand which held above head pushing face forward peering could see pretty gloss which
light shone upon dark dress knew rich
material spoke few words foreign tongue tone though asking question when companion answered gruff monosyllable gave such start lamp nearly
fell hand colonel stark went whispered
something ear then pushing back into room
whence had come walked towards again lamp hand
perhaps will kindness wait room few minutes said throwing open another door quiet little plainly furnished room round table centre which several german books scattered colonel
stark laid down lamp top harmonium beside door shall keep waiting instant said vanished into darkness
glanced books upon table spite ignorance german could see two them treatises

across window hoping might catch some glimpse countryside oak shutter heavily barred folded

standing aperture darkness hall behind
yellow light lamp beating upon eager beautiful face could see glance sick fear sight sent chill own heart held one

like those frightened horse into gloom behind would said trying hard seemed speak calmly would should stay here there good madam said yet done what came cannot possibly leave until seen machine
worth while wait went can pass
through door one hinders then seeing smiled
shook head suddenly threw aside constraint made step forward hands wrung together love
heaven whispered get away here before too
late
somewhat headstrong nature more ready engage affair when there some obstacle way thought fiftyguinea fee wearisome journey unpleasant night which seemed before nothing why should slink away without having carried
out commission without payment which due woman might knew monomaniac stout
bearing therefore though manner had shaken more than cared confess still shook head declared intention
remaining where about renew entreaties
when door slammed overhead sound several footsteps
heard upon stairs listened instant threw hands despairing gesture vanished suddenly noiselessly had come
newcomers colonel lysander stark short thick man
chinchilla beard growing out creases double
chin who introduced ferguson
secretary manager said colonel way under impression left door shut just

colonel lysander stark stopped last before low door which

thoroughly indeed gigantic one capable exercising enormous pressure when passed outside however pressed down levers which controlled knew once whishing sound there slight leakage which allowed
regurgitation water through one side cylinders examination showed one indiarubber bands which round head drivingrod had shrunk quite fill socket along which worked clearly cause

then suddenly silence heard sound which sent heart into mouth clank levers swish
leaking cylinder had set engine work lamp
still stood upon floor where had placed when examining
trough its light saw black ceiling coming
down upon slowly jerkily none knew better than
myself force which must within minute grind shapeless pulp threw myself screaming against door dragged nails lock implored colonel let
out remorseless clanking levers drowned cries ceiling only foot two above head hand upraised could feel its hard rough surface then flashed through mind pain death would depend
very much upon position which met lay face weight would come upon spine shuddered think dreadful snap easier other way perhaps yet had nerve lie look deadly black

moments afterwards clang two slabs metal told narrow had been escape

while woman bent over tugged left hand
while held candle right same good friend
whose warning had foolishly rejected
come come cried breathlessly they will here moment they will see there waste
soprecious time come
time least did scorn advice staggered feet ran along corridor down winding
stair latter led another broad passage just reached heard sound running feet shouting two voices one answering other floor which one beneath guide stopped looked about
like one who wits end then threw open door
which led into bedroom through window which moon
shining brightly
only chance said high may can jump spoke light sprang into view further end passage saw lean figure colonel lysander stark
rushing forward lantern one hand weapon like butchers cleaver other rushed across bedroom
flung open window looked out quiet sweet wholesome garden looked moonlight could more than thirty feet down clambered out upon sill hesitated jump until should heard what passed between
saviour ruffian who pursued illused
then any risks determined back assistance
thought had hardly flashed through mind before door pushing way past threw arms round

mad elise shouted struggling break away will ruin seen too much let pass say dashed one side rushing window cut heavy weapon had let myself hanging hands sill when blow fell conscious dull pain grip loosened fell into garden below
shaken hurt fall picked myself rushed off among bushes hard could run understood far being out danger yet suddenly
however ran deadly dizziness sickness came over glanced down hand which throbbing painfully then first time saw thumb had been cut off blood pouring wound endeavoured tie handkerchief round there came sudden buzzing ears next moment fell dead faint among rosebushes
long remained unconscious cannot tell must been
very long time moon had sunk bright morning breaking when came myself clothes sodden dew coatsleeve drenched blood wounded
thumb smarting recalled instant particulars nights adventure sprang feet feeling might hardly yet safe pursuers astonishment when came look round neither house
nor garden seen had been lying angle hedge close highroad just little lower down long building which proved upon approaching very station which had arrived upon previous night ugly wound upon hand had passed
during those dreadful hours might been evil dream
half dazed went into station asked about morning
train there would one reading less than hour same porter duty found had been there when arrived inquired him whether had ever heard colonel
lysander stark name strange him had observed carriage night before waiting had there policestation anywhere near there one about three
miles off
too far weak ill determined
wait until got back town before telling story police little past six when arrived went first
wound dressed then doctor kind enough bring along here put case into hands shall exactly what advise
both sat silence some little time after listening extraordinary narrative then sherlock holmes pulled down
shelf one ponderous commonplace books which placed cuttings
here advertisement which will interest said appeared papers about year ago listen lost inst jeremiah hayling aged
twentysix hydraulic engineer left lodgings ten
oclock night been heard since dressed etc etc represents last time colonel needed machine overhauled fancy
good heavens cried patient then explains what girl said
undoubtedly quite clear colonel cool desperate man who absolutely determined nothing should
stand way little game like those outandout
pirates who will leave survivor captured ship well
every moment now precious feel equal shall
down scotland yard once preliminary starting eyford
some three hours afterwards train
together bound reading little berkshire village
there sherlock holmes hydraulic engineer inspector
bradstreet scotland yard plainclothes man myself
bradstreet had spread ordnance map county out upon seat busy compasses drawing circle eyford
its centre
there said circle drawn radius ten miles village place want must somewhere
near line said ten miles think sir
hours good drive
think they brought back way when unconscious
they must done confused memory too having
been lifted conveyed somewhere
what cannot understand said why they should spared when they found lying fainting garden
perhaps villain softened womans entreaties
hardly think likely never saw more inexorable face
life
shall soon clear said bradstreet well drawn circle only wish knew what point upon
folk search found
think could lay finger said holmes quietly
really now cried inspector formed opinion come now shall see who agrees say south country more deserted there
say east said patient
west remarked plainclothes man there several quiet little villages there
north said because there hills there
friend says did notice carriage any
come cried inspector laughing its very pretty
diversity opinion boxed compass among who give casting vote wrong
cant yes can point placed finger centre circle where shall find them
twelvemile drive gasped hatherley
six out six back nothing simpler say yourself horse fresh glossy when got could had gone twelve miles over heavy roads
indeed likely ruse enough observed bradstreet
thoughtfully course there can doubt nature
gang
none said holmes they coiners large scale
used machine form amalgam which taken place silver
known some time clever gang work
said inspector they been turning out halfcrowns thousand even traced them far reading could
get farther they had covered their traces way showed they very old hands now thanks lucky chance think got them right enough
inspector mistaken those criminals destined fall into hands justice rolled into
eyford station saw gigantic column smoke which streamed
behind small clump trees neighbourhood hung like immense ostrich feather over landscape
house fire asked bradstreet train steamed off
again its way
yes sir said stationmaster
when did break out
hear during night sir got worse
whole place blaze
whose house bechers
tell broke engineer becher german very
thin long sharp nose
stationmaster laughed heartily sir becher englishman there isnt man parish who betterlined waistcoat gentleman staying him
patient understand who foreigner looks little good berkshire beef would him harm
stationmaster had finished speech before hastening direction fire road topped low
hill there great widespread whitewashed building front spouting fire every chink window while garden front three fireengines vainly striving keep flames under
thats cried hatherley intense excitement there graveldrive there rosebushes where lay second window one jumped well least said holmes had revenge upon
them there can question oillamp which
when crushed press set fire wooden walls
though doubt they too excited chase after observe time now keep eyes open crowd friends last night though very much fear they good hundred miles off now
holmes fears came realised day word ever been heard either beautiful woman sinister german morose englishman early morning peasant had met cart containing several people some very
bulky boxes driving rapidly direction reading there traces fugitives disappeared even holmes
ingenuity failed ever discover least clue their
whereabouts
firemen had been much perturbed strange arrangements
which they had found within still more discovering newly severed human thumb upon windowsill second floor
about sunset however their efforts last successful they subdued flames before roof had fallen whole place been reduced such absolute ruin save
some twisted cylinders iron piping trace remained machinery which had cost unfortunate acquaintance dearly large masses nickel tin discovered stored
outhouse coins found which may explained presence those bulky boxes which been
already referred hydraulic engineer had been conveyed garden spot where recovered senses might remained
forever mystery soft mould which told very plain tale had evidently been carried down two
persons one whom had remarkably small feet other
unusually large ones whole most probable silent englishman being less bold less murderous than companion had assisted woman bear unconscious man out
way danger
well said engineer ruefully took seats return
once more london been pretty business lost thumb lost fiftyguinea fee what
gained
experience said holmes laughing indirectly may value know only put into words gain reputation being excellent company remainder existence
adventure noble bachelor
lord simon marriage its curious termination long ceased subject interest those exalted circles
which unfortunate bridegroom moves fresh scandals eclipsed their more piquant details drawn gossips away fouryearold drama reason believe however full facts never been revealed general public friend sherlock holmes had considerable share clearing matter feel memoir him would complete without some little sketch remarkable episode

ive wasted time enough said lestrade rising believe hard work sitting fire spinning fine theories
goodday holmes shall see which gets bottom
matter first gathered garments thrust them
into bag made door
just one hint lestrade drawled holmes before rival
vanished will tell true solution matter lady
simon myth there there never been any
such person
lestrade looked sadly companion then turned tapped forehead three times shook head solemnly hurried away
had hardly shut door behind him when holmes rose put overcoat there something what fellow says about
outdoor work remarked think watson must
leave papers little
after five oclock when sherlock holmes left had
time lonely within hour there arrived confectioners man very large flat box unpacked
help youth whom had brought him presently very great astonishment quite epicurean
little cold supper began laid out upon humble
lodginghouse mahogany there couple brace cold
woodcock pheasant foie gras pie group ancient cobwebby bottles having laid out these luxuries
two visitors vanished away like genii arabian
nights explanation save things had been paid
ordered address
just before nine oclock sherlock holmes stepped briskly into room features gravely set there light eye which made think had been disappointed conclusions
they laid supper then said rubbing hands
seem expect company they laid five
yes fancy may some company dropping said surprised lord simon already arrived fancy hear step now upon stairs
indeed visitor afternoon who came bustling dangling glasses more vigorously than ever very
perturbed expression upon aristocratic features
messenger reached then asked holmes
yes confess contents startled beyond measure
good authority what say
best possible
lord simon sank into chair passed hand over forehead
what will duke say murmured when hears one family been subjected such humiliation
purest accident cannot allow there any
humiliation
look these things another standpoint
fail see anyone blame can hardly see lady could acted otherwise though abrupt method doing undoubtedly regretted having mother had one advise such crisis
slight sir public slight said lord simon
tapping fingers upon table
must make allowance poor girl placed unprecedented position
will make allowance very angry indeed been shamefully used
think heard ring said holmes yes there steps
landing cannot persuade take lenient view
matter lord simon brought advocate here
who may more successful opened door ushered lady gentleman lord simon said allow introduce mrs francis hay moulton lady think already met
sight these newcomers client had sprung seat stood very erect eyes cast down hand
thrust into breast frockcoat picture offended
dignity lady had taken quick step forward had held out
hand him still refused raise eyes well resolution perhaps pleading face one which hard resist
angry robert said well guess every
cause pray make apology said lord simon bitterly
yes know treated real bad should spoken before went kind rattled time when saw frank here again just
didnt know what doing saying only wonder didnt
fall down faint right there before altar
perhaps mrs moulton would like friend leave
room while explain matter

already part should like europe america hear rights small wiry sunburnt man
cleanshaven sharp face alert manner
then ill tell story right away said lady frank here

much then promised wait him end time pledged myself marry anyone else while lived
why shouldnt married right away then said then will feel sure wont claim husband until come back well talked over had
fixed nicely clergyman ready waiting
just did right there then frank went off seek
fortune went back next heard frank montana then
went prospecting arizona then heard him new
mexico after came long newspaper story about miners camp had been attacked apache indians there franks name among killed fainted dead away very sick months after thought had decline took
half doctors frisco word news came year more never doubted frank really
dead then lord simon came frisco came london
marriage arranged very pleased felt
time man earth would ever take place
heart had been given poor frank
still had married lord simon course done
duty him cant command love can actions went altar him intention make
him just good wife may
imagine what felt when just came altar rails glanced back saw frank standing looking out first pew thought ghost first when looked
again there still kind question eyes ask whether glad sorry see him wonder didnt drop know everything turning round words clergyman just like buzz bee ear didnt know what should stop service make
scene church glanced him again seemed know what thinking raised finger lips tell still then saw him scribble piece paper
knew writing note passed pew way out dropped bouquet over him slipped note into hand when returned flowers only line asking join him when made sign course never doubted moment first duty now
him determined just whatever might direct
when got back told maid who had known him california
had always been friend ordered say nothing get few things packed ulster ready know ought spoken lord simon dreadful hard before
mother those great people just made mind run away explain afterwards hadnt been table ten
minutes before saw frank out window other side road beckoned then began walking into park
slipped out put things followed him some woman
came talking something other about lord simon meseemed little heard had little
secret own before marriage alsobut managed get away
soon overtook frank got into cab together away drove some lodgings had taken gordon square true wedding after those years waiting frank
had been prisoner among apaches had escaped came frisco found had given him dead had gone england followed there had come upon last very morning second wedding

sending line perhaps show him alive awful think those lords ladies sitting
round breakfasttable waiting come back frank took weddingclothes things made bundle them should traced dropped them away
somewhere where one could find them likely should gone paris tomorrow only good
gentleman holmes came round evening though found more than can think showed very
clearly kindly wrong frank right should putting ourselves wrong secret then offered give chance talking lord
simon alone came right away round rooms once now robert heard very sorry given pain hope think very
meanly lord simon had means relaxed rigid attitude had listened frowning brow compressed lip long narrative
excuse said custom discuss most
intimate personal affairs public manner
then wont forgive wont shake hands before certainly would give any pleasure put out
hand coldly grasped which extended him
had hoped suggested holmes would joined friendly supper
think there ask little too much responded lordship may forced acquiesce these recent
developments can hardly expected make merry over
them think permission will now wish very goodnight included sweeping bow stalked out room
then trust least will honour company said sherlock holmes always joy meet american moulton one those who believe folly monarch blundering minister fargone
years will prevent children being some day citizens
same worldwide country under flag which shall quartering union jack stars stripes
case been interesting one remarked holmes when visitors had left because serves show very clearly simple explanation may affair which first sight
seems almost inexplicable nothing could more natural
than sequence events narrated lady nothing
stranger than result when viewed instance lestrade scotland yard
yourself fault then
first two facts very obvious one lady had been quite willing undergo wedding ceremony
other had repented within few minutes returning home obviously something had occurred during morning then cause change mind what could something could spoken anyone when out had been company bridegroom had seen someone then had must someone america
because had spent short time country could hardly allowed anyone acquire deep influence
over mere sight him would induce change
plans completely see already arrived process exclusion idea might seen american then who could american why should possess much influence over might lover might
husband young womanhood had knew been spent rough scenes under strange conditions far had got
before ever heard lord simons narrative when told man pew change brides manner transparent device obtaining note dropping bouquet resort confidential maid very
significant allusion claimjumpingwhich miners parlance
means taking possession which another person prior
claim tothe whole situation became absolutely clear had
gone off man man either lover previous husbandthe chances being favour latter
world did find them
might been difficult friend lestrade held
information hands value which did himself
know initials course highest importance
more valuable still know within week had
settled bill one most select london hotels
did deduce select
select prices eight shillings bed eightpence
glass sherry pointed one most expensive
hotels there many london which charge rate
second one which visited northumberland avenue learned inspection book francis moulton american gentleman had left only day before looking
over entries against him came upon very items which had seen duplicate bill letters forwarded
gordon square thither travelled being fortunate
enough find loving couple home ventured give them
some paternal advice point out them would better every way they should make their position little
clearer both general public lord simon particular invited them meet him here see made him keep appointment
very good result remarked conduct certainly very gracious
watson said holmes smiling perhaps would very gracious either after trouble wooing wedding found yourself deprived instant wife fortune think may judge lord simon very mercifully
thank stars never likely find ourselves same position draw chair hand violin only problem still solve while away
these bleak autumnal evenings
adventure beryl coronet
holmes said stood one morning bowwindow looking
down street here madman coming along seems rather
sad relatives should allow him come out alone
friend rose lazily armchair stood hands
pockets dressinggown looking over shoulder bright crisp february morning snow day
before still lay deep upon ground shimmering brightly wintry sun down centre baker street had been ploughed
into brown crumbly band traffic either side heapedup edges footpaths still lay white when fell grey pavement had been cleaned scraped still dangerously slippery there fewer
passengers than usual indeed direction metropolitan station one coming save single gentleman
whose eccentric conduct had drawn attention
man about fifty tall portly imposing massive strongly marked face commanding figure dressed sombre yet rich style black frockcoat shining
hat neat brown gaiters wellcut pearlgrey trousers yet
actions absurd contrast dignity dress
features running hard occasional little
springs such weary man gives who little accustomed set any tax upon legs ran jerked hands down waggled head writhed face into most
extraordinary contortions
what earth can matter him asked looking numbers houses
believe coming here said holmes rubbing hands
here
yes rather think coming consult professionally think recognise symptoms did tell spoke man puffing blowing rushed door pulled bell until whole house resounded clanging
few moments later room still puffing still
gesticulating fixed look grief despair eyes smiles turned instant horror pity while could get words out swayed body plucked hair like one who been driven extreme limits reason then suddenly springing feet beat head against wall such force both rushed upon him tore him away centre room
sherlock holmes pushed him down into easychair sitting
beside him patted hand chatted him easy
soothing tones which knew well employ
come tell story said fatigued haste pray wait until recovered yourself then shall most happy look into
any little problem which may submit man sat minute more heaving chest fighting
against emotion then passed handkerchief over brow set lips tight turned face towards doubt think mad said see had some great trouble responded holmes
god knows havea trouble which enough unseat reason sudden terrible public disgrace might
faced although man whose character never yet
borne stain private affliction also lot every man
two coming together frightful form been enough shake very soul besides alone
very noblest land may suffer unless some way found
out horrible affair
pray compose yourself sir said holmes let clear account who what befallen
name answered visitor probably familiar ears alexander holder banking firm holder stevenson threadneedle street
name indeed well known belonging senior
partner second largest private banking concern city
london what could happened then bring one foremost citizens london most pitiable pass waited curiosity until another effort braced

here when police inspector suggested should secure
cooperation came baker street underground hurried there foot cabs slowly through snow why out breath man who
takes very little exercise feel better now will put facts before shortly yet clearly can

indeed could wonder such man sir george
burnwell should gain influence over him frequently
brought him house found myself could
hardly resist fascination manner older than
arthur man world fingertips one who had been
everywhere seen everything brilliant talker man great personal beauty yet when think him cold blood far

now holmes know people who live under roof shall continue miserable story
when taking coffee drawingroom night after
dinner told arthur mary experience precious
treasure which had under roof suppressing only name

then goodnight kissed went bedroom
again where soon asleep
endeavouring tell everything holmes which may
any bearing upon case beg will question
upon any point which make clear
contrary statement singularly lucid
come part story now which should wish particularly very heavy sleeper anxiety
mind tended doubt make even less than usual
about two morning then awakened some sound house had ceased ere wide awake had left impression behind though window had gently closed
somewhere lay listening ears suddenly horror there distinct sound footsteps moving softly next room slipped out bed palpitating fear
peeped round corner dressingroom door
arthur screamed villain thief dare touch coronet
gas half had left unhappy boy
dressed only shirt trousers standing beside light holding coronet hands appeared wrenching bending strength cry
dropped grasp turned pale death snatched examined one gold corners three beryls missing
blackguard shouted beside myself rage destroyed dishonoured forever where jewels which stolen
stolen cried
yes thief roared shaking him shoulder
there none missing there cannot any missing said there three missing know where they must call liar well thief did see trying tear off another piece
called names enough said will stand any longer shall say another word about business
since chosen insult will leave house morning make own way world
shall leave hands police cried
halfmad grief rage shall matter probed bottom
shall learn nothing said passion such
should thought nature choose call police let police find what they can
time whole house astir had raised voice anger mary first rush into room sight coronet arthurs face read whole story scream fell down senseless ground sent housemaid police put investigation into their hands once when inspector constable entered house arthur who had stood sullenly arms folded asked whether intention charge
him theft answered had ceased private
matter had become public one since ruined coronet national property determined law should its
way everything
least said will arrested once would advantage well mine might leave house five minutes
may get away perhaps may conceal what stolen said then realising dreadful position
which placed implored him remember only
honour one who far greater than stake threatened raise scandal which would
convulse nation might avert would tell
what had done three missing stones
may well face matter said been caught
act confession could make guilt more heinous
make such reparation power telling
where beryls shall forgiven forgotten
keep forgiveness those who ask answered
turning away sneer saw too hardened
any words mine influence him there one way called inspector gave him into custody search
made once only person room every portion house where could possibly concealed
gems trace them could found nor would wretched boy open mouth persuasions threats morning removed cell after
going through police formalities hurried round implore use skill unravelling matter
police openly confessed they can present make
nothing may any expense which think
necessary already offered reward pounds god what shall lost honour gems son
one night what shall put hand either side head rocked himself fro droning himself like child whose grief got
beyond words
sherlock holmes sat silent some few minutes brows
knitted eyes fixed upon fire
receive much company asked
none save partner family occasional friend arthurs sir george burnwell been several times lately one else think
out much society
arthur does mary stay home neither care unusual young girl
quiet nature besides very young fourandtwenty
matter what say seems been shock also
terrible even more affected than neither any doubt sons guilt
can when saw him own eyes coronet
hands
hardly consider conclusive proof remainder coronet injured
yes twisted
think then might been trying straighten god bless doing what can him too heavy task what doing there purpose innocent why did say precisely guilty why did invent lie
silence appears cut both ways there several
singular points about case what did police think noise which awoke sleep
they considered might caused arthurs closing bedroom door
likely story man bent felony would slam door
wake household what did they say then disappearance these gems
they still sounding planking probing furniture
hope finding them
they thought looking outside house
yes they shown extraordinary energy whole garden already been minutely examined
now dear sir said holmes obvious now
matter really strikes very much deeper than either police first inclined think appeared simple case seems exceedingly complex consider
what involved theory suppose son came
down bed went great risk dressingroom
opened bureau took out coronet broke off main
force small portion went off some other place
concealed three gems out thirtynine such skill nobody can find them then returned other thirtysix
into room which exposed himself greatest danger
being discovered ask now such theory tenable
what other there cried banker gesture despair motives innocent why does explain
them
task find out replied holmes now please holder will set off streatham together
devote hour glancing little more closely into
details
friend insisted upon accompanying them their expedition
which eager enough curiosity sympathy
deeply stirred story which had listened confess guilt bankers son appeared obvious did unhappy father still had such
faith holmes judgment felt there must some
grounds hope long dissatisfied accepted
explanation hardly spoke word whole way out southern suburb sat chin upon breast hat drawn over eyes sunk deepest thought client
appeared taken fresh heart little glimpse hope
which had been presented him even broke into desultory chat over business affairs short railway
journey shorter walk brought fairbank modest
residence great financier
fairbank goodsized square house white stone standing
back little road double carriagesweep snowclad lawn stretched down front two large iron gates
which closed entrance right side small wooden
thicket which led into narrow path between two neat hedges
stretching road kitchen door forming tradesmens entrance left ran lane which led stables itself within grounds being public though little used thoroughfare holmes left standing
door walked slowly round house across front down tradesmens path round garden
behind into stable lane long holder went into diningroom waited fire until should
return sitting there silence when door opened young lady came rather above middle height
slim dark hair eyes which seemed darker against
absolute pallor skin think ever
seen such deadly paleness womans face lips too bloodless eyes flushed crying swept
silently into room impressed greater sense grief than banker had done morning more striking evidently woman strong
character immense capacity selfrestraint disregarding
presence went straight uncle passed hand
over head sweet womanly caress
given orders arthur should liberated dad asked
girl matter must probed bottom
sure innocent know what womans
instincts know done harm will
sorry having acted harshly
why silent then innocent
who knows perhaps because angry should
suspect him
could help suspecting him when actually saw him coronet hand
had only picked look take
word innocent let matter drop say
more dreadful think dear arthur prison
shall never let drop until gems foundnever mary
affection arthur blinds awful consequences
far hushing thing brought gentleman
down london inquire more deeply into gentleman asked facing round friend wished leave him alone round stable lane now
stable lane raised dark eyebrows what can hope find there suppose trust sir
will succeed proving what feel sure truth
cousin arthur innocent crime
fully share opinion trust may
prove returned holmes going back mat knock snow shoes believe honour addressing
miss mary holder might ask question two
pray sir may help clear horrible affair heard nothing yourself last night
nothing until uncle here began speak loudly heard
came down
shut windows doors night before did fasten windows
yes
they fastened morning
yes
maid who sweetheart think remarked
uncle last night had been out see him
yes girl who waited drawingroom who may heard uncles remarks about coronet
see infer may gone out tell sweetheart two may planned robbery
what good these vague theories cried banker impatiently when told saw arthur coronet hands
wait little holder must come back about girl miss holder saw return kitchen door presume
yes when went see door fastened night met slipping saw man too gloom
know him
yes greengrocer who brings vegetables round
name francis prosper
stood said holmes left doorthat say farther path than necessary reach door
yes did
man wooden leg
something like fear sprang young ladys expressive
black eyes why like magician said know smiled there answering smile holmes thin eager face
should very glad now upstairs said shall
probably wish over outside house again perhaps
had better take look lower windows before walked swiftly round one other pausing only large one which looked hall onto stable lane
opened made very careful examination sill
powerful magnifying lens now shall upstairs
said last
bankers dressingroom plainly furnished little
chamber grey carpet large bureau long mirror
holmes went bureau first looked hard lock
which key used open asked
which son himself indicatedthat cupboard lumberroom
here
dressingtable
sherlock holmes took opened bureau
noiseless lock said wonder did
wake case presume contains coronet must
look opened case taking out diadem
laid upon table magnificent specimen jewellers art thirtysix stones finest ever seen one side coronet cracked edge
where corner holding three gems had been torn away
now holder said holmes here corner which
corresponds which been unfortunately lost might beg will break off
banker recoiled horror should dream trying
said then will holmes suddenly bent strength upon without result feel give little said though
exceptionally strong fingers would take time break ordinary man could now what think would happen did break holder there would
noise like pistol shot tell happened within few yards bed heard
nothing know what think dark perhaps may grow lighter what think
miss holder
confess still share uncles perplexity
son had shoes slippers when saw him
had nothing save only trousers shirt
thank certainly been favoured extraordinary
luck during inquiry will entirely own fault
succeed clearing matter permission holder shall now continue investigations
outside
went alone own request explained any
unnecessary footmarks might make task more difficult hour more work returning last feet
heavy snow features inscrutable ever
think seen now there see holder said can serve best returning rooms
gems holmes where they
cannot tell
banker wrung hands shall never see them again cried son give hopes
opinion way altered
then gods sake what dark business which acted house last night
can call upon baker street rooms tomorrow
morning between nine ten shall happy what can make clearer understand give carte blanche act provided only get back gems place limit sum may draw
would give fortune them back
very good shall look into matter between then
goodbye just possible may come over here
again before evening
obvious companions mind now made about case although what conclusions more than
could even dimly imagine several times during homeward
journey endeavoured sound him upon point always
glided away some other topic until last gave over despair yet three when found ourselves rooms once more hurried chamber down again few minutes dressed common loafer collar turned
shiny seedy coat red cravat worn boots perfect sample class
think should said glancing into glass
above fireplace only wish could come watson fear wont may trail matter may following willothewisp shall soon know which hope may back few
hours cut slice beef joint upon sideboard
sandwiched between two rounds bread thrusting rude meal into pocket started off upon expedition
had just finished tea when returned evidently excellent spirits swinging old elasticsided boot hand chucked down into corner helped himself cup tea
only looked passed said going right where other side west end may some time
before get back dont wait case should late
getting nothing complain been out streatham
since saw last did call house very sweet little problem would missed good deal however must sit gossiping here must get
these disreputable clothes off return highly
respectable self
could see manner had stronger reasons satisfaction than words alone would imply eyes twinkled
there even touch colour upon sallow cheeks hastened upstairs few minutes later heard slam hall door which told off once more upon congenial hunt
waited until midnight there sign return retired room uncommon thing him away
days nights end when hot upon scent lateness caused surprise know what hour came when came down breakfast morning there
cup coffee one hand paper other fresh trim possible
will excuse beginning without watson said remember client rather early appointment morning
why after nine now answered should surprised thought heard ring
indeed friend financier shocked change which had come over him face which naturally
broad massive mould now pinched fallen while hair seemed least shade whiter entered
weariness lethargy which even more painful than
violence morning before dropped heavily into
armchair which pushed forward him
know what done severely tried said
only two days ago happy prosperous man without
care world now left lonely dishonoured
age one sorrow comes close upon heels another niece
mary deserted deserted yes bed morning had been slept room empty note lay upon hall table had said last night sorrow anger had
married boy might been well him perhaps thoughtless say remark refers
note
dearest unclei feel brought trouble upon had acted differently terrible misfortune
might never occurred cannot thought mind ever again happy under roof feel must
leave forever worry about future provided above search will
fruitless labour illservice life death ever lovingmary
what could mean note holmes think points suicide
nothing kind perhaps best possible
solution trust holder nearing end troubles
say heard something holmes learned something where gems
would think pounds apiece excessive sum them
would pay ten
would unnecessary three thousand will cover matter
there little reward fancy checkbook
here pen better make out pounds
dazed face banker made out required check holmes
walked over desk took out little triangular piece gold three gems threw down upon table
shriek joy client clutched gasped saved saved
reaction joy passionate grief had been hugged recovered gems bosom
there one other thing owe holder said sherlock
holmes rather sternly
owe caught pen name sum will pay debt owe very humble apology noble lad son who carried himself matter should proud see own son should ever chance one
then arthur who took them
told yesterday repeat today sure then let hurry him once let him
know truth known
knows already when had cleared had interview him finding would tell story told him which had confess right add very few details which yet quite
clear news morning however may open lips
heavens sake tell then what extraordinary
mystery
will will show steps which reached
let say first which hardest say hear there been understanding
between sir george burnwell niece mary they now
fled together
mary impossible
unfortunately more than possible certain neither
nor son knew true character man when admitted him into family circle one most
dangerous men englanda ruined gambler absolutely
desperate villain man without heart conscience niece
knew nothing such men when breathed vows had done hundred before flattered herself alone had touched heart devil knows best what said
least became tool habit seeing
him nearly every evening
cannot will believe cried banker ashen face
will tell then what occurred house last night
niece when had thought gone room
slipped down talked lover through window which
leads into stable lane footmarks had pressed right
through snow long had stood there told him coronet wicked lust gold kindled news bent will doubt loved there women whom love lover extinguishes other loves think must been one had
hardly listened instructions when saw coming
downstairs which closed window rapidly told about one servants escapade woodenlegged lover
which perfectly true
boy arthur went bed after interview slept badly account uneasiness about club debts
middle night heard soft tread pass door
rose looking out surprised see cousin
walking very stealthily along passage until disappeared
into dressingroom petrified astonishment lad
slipped some clothes waited there dark see what
would come strange affair presently emerged room again light passagelamp son saw
carried precious coronet hands passed
down stairs thrilling horror ran along slipped behind curtain near door whence could see
what passed hall beneath saw stealthily open window hand out coronet someone gloom then
closing once more hurry back room passing quite close
where stood hid behind curtain
long scene could take any action
without horrible exposure woman whom loved instant gone realised crushing misfortune
would allimportant set right rushed down just bare feet opened
window sprang out into snow ran down lane
where could see dark figure moonlight sir george
burnwell tried get away arthur caught him there struggle between them lad tugging one side coronet opponent other scuffle son
struck sir george cut him over eye then something
suddenly snapped son finding had coronet
hands rushed back closed window ascended room had just observed coronet had been twisted struggle endeavouring straighten when appeared upon scene
possible gasped banker
then roused anger calling him names moment when
felt had deserved warmest thanks could explain true state affairs without betraying one who
certainly deserved little enough consideration hands took more chivalrous view however preserved secret
why shrieked fainted when saw coronet cried holder god what blind fool been asking allowed out five minutes
dear fellow wanted see missing piece scene struggle cruelly misjudged him
when arrived house continued holmes once went
very carefully round observe there any traces snow which might help knew none had fallen since
evening before also there had been strong frost
preserve impressions passed along tradesmens path found trampled down indistinguishable just beyond however far side kitchen door woman had stood
talked man whose round impressions one side showed
had wooden leg could even tell they had been
disturbed woman had run back swiftly door shown deep toe light heel marks while woodenleg had
waited little then had gone away thought time
might maid sweetheart whom had
already spoken inquiry showed passed
round garden without seeing anything more than random tracks
which took police when got into stable
lane very long complex story written snow front there double line tracks booted man second
double line which saw delight belonged man naked
feet once convinced what had told latter son first had walked both ways other had run swiftly tread marked places over
depression boot obvious had passed
after other followed them found they led hall window where boots had worn snow away while
waiting then walked other end which hundred
yards more down lane saw where boots had faced round
where snow cut though there had been struggle
finally where few drops blood had fallen show mistaken boots had then run down lane another little smudge blood showed who had been
hurt when came highroad other end found pavement had been cleared there end clue
entering house however examined remember sill framework hall window lens could
once see someone had passed out could distinguish outline instep where wet foot had been placed coming
then beginning able form opinion what
had occurred man had waited outside window someone had
brought gems deed had been overseen son had
pursued thief had struggled him they had each tugged
coronet their united strength causing injuries which
neither alone could effected had returned prize had left fragment grasp opponent far clear question now who man who
brought him coronet
old maxim mine when excluded impossible whatever remains however improbable must truth now knew who had brought down
there only remained niece maids maids why should son allow himself accused their place there could possible reason loved cousin however there excellent explanation why should
retain secretthe more secret disgraceful
one when remembered had seen window had fainted seeing coronet again conjecture
became certainty
who could who confederate lover evidently
who else could outweigh love gratitude which must
feel knew went out little circle friends very limited one among them sir
george burnwell had heard him before being man evil
reputation among women must been who wore those boots
retained missing gems even though knew arthur
had discovered him might still flatter himself safe lad could say word without compromising own family
well own good sense will suggest what measures took
next went shape loafer sir georges house
managed pick acquaintance valet learned master had cut head night before finally expense six shillings made sure buying pair castoff shoes these journeyed down streatham saw they exactly fitted tracks
saw illdressed vagabond lane yesterday evening
said holder
precisely found had man came home
changed clothes delicate part which had play then saw prosecution must avoided avert
scandal knew astute villain would see hands tied matter went saw him first course denied everything when gave him every
particular had occurred tried bluster took down lifepreserver wall knew man however clapped pistol head before could strike then became little more reasonable told him would give
him price stones held pounds apiece brought out first signs grief had shown why
dash said ive let them six hundred three soon managed get address receiver who had
them promising him there would prosecution off set him after much chaffering got stones pounds apiece then looked upon son told him right eventually got bed about two oclock after
what may call really hard days work
day which saved england great public scandal said
banker rising sir cannot find words thank shall find ungrateful what done skill indeed exceeded heard now must fly dear boy apologise him wrong which done him what tell poor mary goes very heart even skill can inform where now
think may safely say returned holmes wherever sir george burnwell equally certain too whatever sins they will soon receive more than
sufficient punishment
xii adventure copper beeches
man who loves art its own sake remarked sherlock
holmes tossing aside advertisement sheet daily

truth these little records cases which been good enough draw bound say
occasionally embellish given prominence much
many causes clbres sensational trials which figured rather those incidents which may been
trivial themselves which given room those
faculties deduction logical synthesis which made

which had more than once observed strong factor friends singular character
selfishness conceit said answering wont thoughts rather than words claim full
justice art because impersonal thinga
thing beyond myself crime common logic rare therefore upon logic rather than upon crime should

cold morning early spring sat after
breakfast either side cheery fire old room baker street thick fog rolled down between lines duncoloured houses opposing windows loomed like dark
shapeless blurs through heavy yellow wreaths gas lit
shone white cloth glimmer china metal table had been cleared yet sherlock holmes had been
silent morning dipping continuously into advertisement columns succession papers until last
having apparently given search had emerged very
sweet temper lecture upon literary shortcomings
same time remarked after pause during which had sat puffing long pipe gazing down into fire
can hardly open charge sensationalism out these cases which been kind interest yourself
fair proportion treat crime its legal sense
small matter which endeavoured help king
bohemia singular experience miss mary sutherland problem connected man twisted lip incident noble bachelor matters which outside pale law avoiding sensational fear may bordered trivial

pshaw dear fellow what public great unobservant
public who could hardly tell weaver tooth compositor left thumb care about finer shades analysis deduction indeed trivial cannot
blame days great cases past man least criminal man lost enterprise originality own little practice seems degenerating into agency recovering lost lead pencils giving advice young ladies boardingschools think touched

they could their pick pounds there must some
strong reason behind
thought told circumstances would
understand afterwards wanted help should feel much stronger felt back may carry feeling away assure little problem promises most interesting which come way some months there something distinctly novel
about some features should find yourself doubt
danger
danger what danger foresee
holmes shook head gravely would cease danger could define said any time day night telegram would bring down help
enough rose briskly chair anxiety swept face shall down hampshire
quite easy mind now shall write rucastle once
sacrifice poor hair tonight start winchester

goodnight bustled off upon way
least said heard quick firm steps descending
stairs seems young lady who very well able
take care herself
would need said holmes gravely much
mistaken hear before many days past
very long before friends prediction fulfilled
fortnight went during which frequently found thoughts
turning direction wondering what strange sidealley human experience lonely woman had strayed into unusual
salary curious conditions light duties pointed something abnormal though whether fad plot whether
man philanthropist villain quite beyond
powers determine holmes observed sat
frequently half hour end knitted brows abstracted air swept matter away wave hand when mentioned data data data cried
impatiently cant make bricks without clay yet would
always wind muttering sister should ever
accepted such situation
telegram which eventually received came late one night
just thinking turning holmes settling down
one those allnight chemical researches which frequently
indulged when would leave him stooping over retort testtube night find him same position when came
down breakfast morning opened yellow envelope

eleven oclock next day well upon way old english capital holmes had been buried morning papers
way down after had passed hampshire border threw them down began admire scenery ideal
spring day light blue sky flecked little fleecy white
clouds drifting across west east sun shining
very brightly yet there exhilarating nip air
which set edge mans energy over countryside
away rolling hills around aldershot little red grey roofs farmsteadings peeped out amid light
green new foliage
they fresh beautiful cried enthusiasm man fresh fogs baker street
holmes shook head gravely
know watson said one curses mind turn like mine must look everything reference own special subject look these scattered
houses impressed their beauty look them
only thought which comes feeling their
isolation impunity which crime may committed
there
good heavens cried who would associate crime these
dear old homesteads
they always fill certain horror belief
watson founded upon experience lowest vilest
alleys london present more dreadful record sin
than does smiling beautiful countryside
horrify reason very obvious pressure public opinion
can town what law cannot accomplish there lane vile scream tortured child thud drunkards blow does beget sympathy indignation among
neighbours then whole machinery justice ever
close word complaint can set going there step between crime dock look these
lonely houses each its own fields filled most part
poor ignorant folk who know little law think deeds hellish cruelty hidden wickedness which may year year out such places none wiser had lady who appeals help gone live winchester should never had fear five miles country which makes danger still clear personally threatened
can come winchester meet can get away
quite freedom
what can matter then can suggest explanation
devised seven separate explanations each which would
cover facts far know them which these correct can only determined fresh information which shall doubt find waiting well there tower cathedral shall soon learn miss hunter tell

actual illtreatment mrs rucastle only fair them say cannot understand them easy mind about them
what can understand
their reasons their conduct shall just

southertons preserves clump copper beeches immediately front hall door given its name place
driven over employer who amiable ever
introduced him evening wife child
there truth holmes conjecture which seemed probable rooms baker street mrs rucastle mad found silent palefaced woman much
younger than husband more than thirty should think
while can hardly less than fortyfive their
conversation gathered they been married about
seven years widower only child first wife daughter who gone philadelphia rucastle told private reason why had left them
had unreasoning aversion stepmother daughter could been less than twenty can quite
imagine position must been uncomfortable fathers young wife
mrs rucastle seemed colourless mind well feature impressed neither favourably nor reverse
nonentity easy see passionately
devoted both husband little son light grey
eyes wandered continually one other noting every
little want forestalling possible kind also bluff boisterous fashion whole they
seemed happy couple yet had some secret sorrow
woman would often lost deep thought saddest look upon face more than once surprised tears thought sometimes disposition child which weighed upon mind never met utterly spoiled illnatured little creature small
age head which quite disproportionately large
whole life appears spent alternation between
savage fits passion gloomy intervals sulking giving
pain any creature weaker than himself seems one idea
amusement shows quite remarkable talent planning
capture mice little birds insects would
rather talk about creature holmes indeed little story
glad details remarked friend whether they
seem relevant shall try miss anything importance one
unpleasant thing about house which struck once appearance conduct servants there only two man wife toller name rough
uncouth man grizzled hair whiskers perpetual
smell drink twice since been them been
quite drunk yet rucastle seemed take notice wife very tall strong woman sour face silent mrs rucastle much less amiable they most
unpleasant couple fortunately spend most time nursery own room which next each other one

both extremely obliged
dress which found waiting peculiar shade
blue excellent material sort beige bore unmistakable signs having been worn before could been better fit had been measured both mrs rucastle expressed delight look which
seemed quite exaggerated its vehemence they waiting drawingroom which very large room stretching
along entire front house three long windows
reaching down floor chair had been placed close central window its back turned towards asked sit then rucastle walking down other side room began tell series funniest
stories ever listened cannot imagine comical laughed until quite weary mrs
rucastle however who evidently sense humour never much smiled sat hands lap sad
anxious look upon face after hour rucastle
suddenly remarked time commence duties day might change dress little edward nursery
two days later same performance gone through under
exactly similar circumstances again changed dress again sat window again laughed very heartily funny
stories which employer had immense rpertoire which
told inimitably then handed yellowbacked novel moving chair little sideways own shadow might fall upon page begged read aloud him read about ten minutes beginning heart chapter then
suddenly middle sentence ordered cease change dress
can easily imagine holmes curious became what meaning extraordinary performance could possibly
they always very careful observed turn face
away window became consumed desire
see what going behind back first seemed impossible soon devised means handmirror had been
broken happy thought seized concealed piece glass handkerchief next occasion midst
laughter put handkerchief eyes able
little management see there behind confess disappointed there nothing least first impression second glance however perceived there man standing southampton road
small bearded man grey suit who seemed looking direction road important highway there usually people there man however leaning against railings which bordered field looking earnestly lowered handkerchief glanced mrs rucastle find eyes fixed upon most searching gaze said nothing
convinced had divined had mirror hand had seen what behind rose once
jephro said there impertinent fellow upon road there who stares miss hunter
friend yours miss hunter asked

surely would better take notice
should him loitering here always kindly turn
round wave him away like did told same instant mrs rucastle drew
down blind week ago time sat again window nor worn blue dress nor
seen man road
pray continue said holmes narrative promises most interesting one
will find rather disconnected fear there may
prove little relation between different incidents which speak very first day copper
beeches rucastle took small outhouse which stands
near kitchen door approached heard sharp
rattling chain sound large animal moving
about
look here said rucastle showing slit between two
planks beauty
